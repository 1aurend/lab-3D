# 5.1 Reptiliomorpha


### (Early Carboniferous - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Pleurocentrum is dominant element of vertebral body](#21_archeriaverts)**
*   **[Elongate ribs](#201_sphenodonwhole)** for costal breathing

**Reptiliomorpha** (“crawling-shape”) are the total-group amniotes, and include four stem groups: the Anthracosauria, the Seymouriamorpha, the Lepospondyli (which we discussed in Lab 4), and the Diadectimorpha in addition to the amniote crown.

First to diverge are the **[Anthracosauria](#305_seymouriabaylorensiswhole)** (“coal-lizards”), a group of amphibious tetrapods known from lakes and swamps of coal forests. Anthracosaurs were very diverse, and ranged in length from 50cm to over 3m. Anthracosaurs present a mosaic of amniote and non-amniote features: on the one hand, their **elongate ribs**(for costal ventilation), robust limbs and girdles (for terrestrial locomotion), and small, tall skulls (for vertically-aligned jaw muscles) are all terrestrialized traits that resemble those of more derived amniotes; on the other hand, they retain some plesiomorphic traits such as an otic notch (stapes is still used for hearing), labyrinthodont palatal tusks, and a lateral line system (underwater sensory apparatus). As you can see from **_[Archeria](#21_archeriaverts)_**, the vertebral centra are formed with equal contributions from large, disk-shaped pleurocentra and intercentra.

The **Seymouriamorpha** are an Early Permian group comprising two distinct morphs, both of which went through metamorphosis. The **expanded neural arches** of species like **_[Seymouria](#306_seymouriaslab)_**provided increased surface area for epaxial muscles to attach to, indicating a primarily terrestrial lifestyle. The **pleurocentrum** has increased in size relative to the intercentrum, and is now the **dominant element of the vertebral body**.

The **[Diadectimorpha](#7_diadectesskull)** lived from the Late Carboniferous to the Early Permian, and were the last step on the line to crown amniotes. This group is more derived than the lepospondyls, having **lost both the lateral line system and the otic notch.**  There is evidence of a shift away from plesiomorphic inertial feeding and towards derived **static pressure feeding**—the palate lacks tusks, and an **incipient pterygoid flange** suggests the presence of a pterygoideus muscle. Two major groups are known: the carnivorous, semi-aquatic **[limnoscelids,](#308_limnosceliswhole)** and the large, herbivorous **[diadectiids](#307_diadectesphaseolinuswhole)**, which possessed massive girdles and small peglike teeth.


# 5.2 Amniota


### (Early Carboniferous - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Amniotic egg](#309_crocodylusegg)**
*   **[Dermal girdle is reduced](#201_sphenodonwhole)**
*   **[Pterygoid flange ](#310_alligatormississippiensiscranium)**
*   **[Astragalus in ankle ](#201_sphenodonwhole)**
*   **[Otic/tympanic notch lost](#310_alligatormississippiensiscranium)**
*   **[Stapes braces skull and jaw](#204_varanussalvatorskull)**
*   **[Small head](#201_sphenodonwhole)** (no longer used for breathing)
*   **[Single rounded occipital condyle](#310_alligatormississippiensiscranium)**

**Amniota** is defined as the clade including the ancestor of living mammals, ‘reptiles,’ and birds,  as well as all of that ancestor’s descendants. This unites two lineages: the **Synapsida** and the **Sauropsida**. We will return to synapsids towards the end of the course, beginning with Lab 8. The tiny Early Carboniferous **_[Casineria](#311_casineriakiddislab)_**  is known only from as a post-cranial skeleton with strongly ossified, gracile limbs, and is often considered to be the earliest known amniote.

Amniotes are characterized by a number of important features, all relating in one way or another to a terrestrial lifestyle. Perhaps the most important innovation was the **amniotic egg.** While even the most terrestrialized non-amniote tetrapods must return to the water to lay their eggs lest they dry out, the complex, shelled amniotic egg provides multiple layers of protection to the developing embryo, and allows amniotes to finally reproduce away from the water. The shell provides both mechanical and mineral support; the chorion furnishes a protective cushion; the amnion prevents desiccation; the allantois promotes gas exchange and waste excretion; and finally the yolk sac fuels prolonged development. Early amniote eggs are very rare in the fossil record, but here at the MCZ we happen to have the **[oldest known amniotic egg](#4_amniotaegg)** ever found.

Remember how the **reduction of the dermal girdle**to create a neck was a key step in the evolution of tetrapods? Amniotes continue the trend of shrinking various elements of the dermal pectoral girdle: the cleithrum, clavicle, and interclavicle are independently reduced (and sometimes lost) within the sauropsid and synapsid lines.

Unlike non-amniote tetrapods, which use buccal pumping to ventilate their lungs (and therefore need large, flat skulls to move more air), amniotes shift the task of breathing to their ribs (costal ventilation), and have relatively tall, small skulls. This change in skull shape has the effect of reorienting the jaw-closing adductor mandibulae muscle to be more vertical. Together with the presence of the new pterygoideus muscle (reflected in the development of a **pterygoid flange** for it to attach to), this permitted a transition away from plesiomorphic inertial snapping feeding (enclosing food with the jaws in a single snapping motion) and towards derived static pressure feeding (biting down on food and applying pressure with marginal teeth). The ear has also been reconfigured: the **stapes now serves as a brace[](#204_varanussalvatorskull)supportingthe skull,** and the **otic notch is now lost.**

We end up talking about ankle morphology a lot, for a couple of reasons: dense, compact tarsal bones tend to preserve well, and they contain useful information about the locomotor habits of the animals they come from. The formation of an **astragalus** from the fusion of multiple ankle bones provided increased stiffness and stability to the foot (=pes) for getting around better on land.


# 5.3 Sauropsida


### (Middle Permian - Present)

**Sauropsida** (“lizard-arch”) is the lineage that includes all amniotes more closely related to turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodylians, and birds than to mammals. One of the first major groups are the **Parareptilia,** sauropsids that were thought by some to be related to turtles. Regardless of their true affinities, we will save our discussion of these animals for Lab 7 due to their historical significance to our understanding of turtle evolution.

**[Captorhinids](#31_captorhinusskull)** (“snatching-snout”) were small Permian animals with large, textured, heart-shaped skulls. They used their multiple rows of peglike teeth for grinding either plants or hard shells. The Late Carboniferous **Romeriids,**such as **_[Romeria](#5_romeriaskull)_**and **_[Protorothyris](#27_protorothyrisverts)_**, are well-known for being found in fossilized tree stumps.


# 5.4 Diapsida


### (Carboniferous - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Supratemporal and infratemporal fenestrae](#202_sphenodonskull)**
*   **[Elongate cervical region](#26_araeosceliswhole)**

Amniotes are classically divided into **anapsids,**(“without-arch”) **synapsids,**(“together-arch”) **** and **diapsids** (“two-arch”) based on the number and location of temporal fenestrae on their skulls. These openings are thought to accommodate more extensive attachments for larger jaw muscles, while also permitting these muscles to bulge outwards for greater force production.

**Diapsida** unites all sauropsids that possess **both** **supratemporal** **and infratemporal fenestrae.** This group traditionally includes all living sauropsids except turtles. The lower (infratemporal) fenestra is bounded dorsally by the postorbital and squamosal and ventrally by the jugal and quadratojugal. This opening is in the same position as the **[single, convergently-derived fenestra](#312_inostranceviaalexandriskull)**  in synapsids. The upper (supratemporal) fenestra is between the postorbital and squamosal on the lateral edge and the parietal medially. There is a great deal of variation and evolution in skull morphology, so don’t be surprised when fenestrae move around or disappear.

The first diapsids were the small, superficially lizard-like **Araeoscelidia,** which are known from the Late Carboniferous to the Early Permian. These animals were small and superficially resembled lizards. The specimen of **_[Araeoscelis](#26_araeosceliswhole)_** out in lab actually happens to be the holotype, and shows the **elongated early diapsid neck** clearly.

Diapsida also includes several major groups of mesozoic marine reptiles, including plesiosaurs (Sauropterygia) and ichthyosaurs (Ichthyopterygia). We will discuss these groups, along with other marine reptiles, in Lab 7.

More derived diapsids are grouped together under **Neodiapsida.** This is a somewhat unnecessary node lacking clear synapomorphies, so we do not require you to know it. In addition to members of Sauria proper, this also likely includes the arboreal, gliding members of the **[Coelurosauravidae](#319_coelurosauravuswhole)** (formerly Weigeltisauridae) from the Permian, and the small ‘lizard-like’[ ‘Younginiformes’](#320_younginawhole) from the Late Permian and Early Triassic. The possibly-paraphyletic Younginiformes encompass both aquatic and terrestrial forms, and are mostly known from post-crania.


# 5.5 Sauria


### (Middle Permian - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Slender, S-shaped femur](#22_homoeosaurusmaximilianiwhole)**

**Sauria** unites the lineage leading to extant lizards and snakes, the **Lepidosauromorpha,** with the lineage leading to extant crocodylians and birds, the **Archosauromorpha.** Sauria is a crown group that, depending on the phylogenetic position of turtles, may or may not be synonymous with crown ‘reptiles’ (we will return to this point later).


# 5.6 Lepidosauromorpha


### (Permian - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Quadrate conch](#205_lacertamuralisskull)**
*   **[Entepicondylar foramen](#201_sphenodonwhole)** in humerus
*   **[Pleurodont teeth](#331_cycluracyclurajaw)**
*   Trend towards **[reduction of lower temporal bar](#207_agamastellioskull)**
*   Trend towards **[single-headed ribs](#208_gekkogekkowhole)**

**Lepidosauromorpha** (“scale-lizard-shape”) are those saurians closer to (and including) living lizards and snakes than to crocodylians and birds. There are a few known stem lepidosaurs, but the fossil record outside the crown is rather incomplete. Some early-diverging examples are **_[Palaeagama](#321_palaeagamawhole),_**the small, gliding **_[Kuehneosauridae](#322_icarosauruswhole),_** and the Early Triassic **_[Sophineta](#323_sophinetacracoviensisskull)_**.

All lepidosauromorphs feature a **quadrate conch** (you will also see this referred to as a laterally-embayed quadrate) superficially resembling a human external ear. An **entepicondylar foramen** on the medial side of the distal end of the humerus gives passage to a neurovascular bundle, although the presence of this structure is rather variable in extant lepidosaurs.

While dental implantation varies within crown lepidosaurs, the plesiomorphic lepidosauromorph condition is **[pleurodonty](#325_cycluracycluraskull)**(“side-tooth”)**,** where continuously-replaced teeth are attached to the medial, or lingual, surface of the jaw. The **acrodont** (“end-/top-tooth”) condition, where teeth are attached directly to the ridge at the apex of the jawbone, is found in **_[Sphenodon](#202_sphenodonskull),_[chameleons](#200_chameleondilepisskull),**and **[agamid iguanians](#207_agamastellioskull),**while the socketed archosaurian **thecodont** (“capsule-tooth”) condition is found in **[mosasaurs](#324_prognathodontooth)** and **[snakes](#177_pythonamethystinusskull)**(although some refer to the shallow-socketed teeth in these animals as **“subthecodont”**, and consider them distinct from the deep-socketed true thecodont condition).


# 5.7 Lepidosauria


### (Middle Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Fused frontals](#171_hemidactylusfrenatusskull)**
*   **[Hooked fifth metatarsal](#15_polyglyphanodonwhole) **and **[fused astragalocalcaneum](#209_helodermahorridumwhole)**
*   **[Ossified epiphyses ](#47_salvatormerianaeossifiedepiphyses)**(compare with **[unossified archosaur epiphyses](#192_gallusunossifiedepiphyses)**)
*   **[Caudal autotomy](#208_gekkogekkowhole)**
*   **[Skin shed in sheets](#326_dracomelanopogonshedding)**
*   **[Intromittent organ](#327_crotalusatroxhemipenes)**

**Lepidosauria** (“scale-lizard”) unites the lizards and snakes (**Squamata**) with the tuatara (**_Sphenodon_**). The tuatara is the last living representative of the lineage **Rynchocephalia**(“beak-head”)**,** which has an extensive Mesozoic fossil record and has persisted from the Triassic to the present day.

**_[Sphenodon](#202_sphenodonskull)_** is unique among living lepidosaurs in having a true diapsid skull condition with a **complete infratemporal fenestra,** but this is most likely a derived feature as extinct rhynchocephalians did not have a complete lower temporal bar. It also has a modified jaw joint that accommodates a back-and-forth **propalinal motion**for shearing food. _Sphenodon’s**[postcranial skeleton](#201_sphenodonwhole)**_ has a few other unusual characteristics as well: its ribs feature hooked **uncinate proceses,**it possesses **gastralia** (belly ribs), and its vertebrae are **amphicoelous.**New Zealand is the only place in the world where you can still find this last member of the once-diverse rhynchocephalians.


# 5.8 Squamata


### (Lower Jurassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **Cranial kinesis via [streptostyly](#333_iguanaiguanaskull)** (some have **[mesokinetic](#328_uroplatusfimbriatusskull)** and **[metakinetic](#332_lialisburtoniswhole)** joints)
*   **[Procoelous vertebrae](#338_varanussalvatorpelvis)** with accessory **[zygosphene-zygantrum articulation](#360_eunectesmurinusvertebra)**.
*   **Chemoreception** via **bifurcated tongue**and **[elaborated vomeronasal organ](#339_corallusendocast)**

**Squamata **(“scaled”), which unites lizards with snakes, is fantastically diverse. Various squamate groups have independently evolved limblessness, including the limbless **[pygopodid geckos](#332_lialisburtoniswhole)**, the **[burrowing](#206_amphisbaenafuliginosaskull)** **[amphisbaenids](#141_macrorhineuraskinneriskull)**, the grass lizards of **_[Chamaesaura](#329_chamaesauraanguinawhole),_** various **[skinks](#335_feyliniacurroriwhole)**, and of course the snakes of **[Serpentes](#330_bitiscaudaliswhole)** (total group Ophidia).

**Skull kinesis** is an important synapomorphy of squamates. The ancestral squamate lacked a lower temporal bar, allowing the quadrate to move more freely. This is called **‘[streptostyly](#207_agamastellioskull)’** and allows squamates to open their jaws more fully. The oldest known squamate, **_[Megachirella](#346_megachirellawachtlerislab)_**from the Middle Triassic of Italy, features a reduced lower temporal bar, presaging the development of greater cranial mobility in later squamates. Some squamates, like geckos, possess a joint between the frontal and the parietal. This **[mesokinetic](#328_uroplatusfimbriatusskull)** joint enables the front of the face to flex up and down. This is particularly useful for keeping prey in the mouth as the animal bites down. Some groups, like pygopodids, go even further and evolve a **[metakinetic](#332_lialisburtoniswhole)** joint between the braincase and the skull roof. **[Snakes](#334_corallusskull)**, of course, take cranial kinesis to a whole other level, from the **[hinged, expanding skulls and separated mandibles](#212_heterodonplatirhinoseatingfrog)** of the **[macrostomatans](#211_crotalusadamanteusskull)** to the **[maxillary](#210_typhlopslumbricalismaxillaryrake)**and **[mandibular rakes](#215_leptotyphlopsscutifronsmandibularrake)** of the scolecophidian blind snakes.


# 5.9 Archosauromorpha


### (Late Permian - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Slender, tapering cervical ribs](#50_allosaurusneck)**
*   **[Large posterior iliac process ](#340_prestosuchuswhole)**
*   **[Sagittal crest](#344_rhynchosaurusarticepsskull)**
*   **[Subthecodont teeth](#177_pythonamethystinusskull)**

The other saurian lineage are the **Archosauromorpha** (“first-lizard-shape”), those animals more closely related to birds and crocodylians than to lepidosaurs. This includes a series of basal lineages that mostly form a series of progressive outgroups to more derived clades. The most basal group are the **Protorosauria,**  which are known from the Late Permian to the Late Triassic. They are an unusual group including many animals with long necks, like **_[Macrocnemus](#341_macrocnemuswhole),_**the **[tanystropheids](#342_tanystropheuswhole)** and the odd, arboreal **[drepanosaurs](#343_megalancosauruspreonensiswhole),**which resembled chameleons with bird-like heads.

The massive, beaked **[Rhynchosauria](#344_rhynchosaurusarticepsskull)** (“beak-lizard”) **** were herbivores common in the Triassic, and possessed rows of teeth on the maxilla, dentary, and palatine, an unusual style of jaw occlusion, and a well-developed sagittal crest on their large heads.

The likely sister taxon to archosauriformes is **_[Prolacerta](#345_prolacertabroomiskull)_**(“before-lizard”), known from the Late Permian to Early Triassic of Antarctica and South Africa. This animal superficially resembles modern lizards, but its long snout, narrow skull, and recurved teeth align it instead with the archosauriformes.


# 5.10 Archosauriformes


### (Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Antorbital and mandibular fenestrae](#340_prestosuchuswhole)**
*   **[Thecodont teeth](#347_alligatorsinensiscranium)**
*   **[Acetabular foramen](#12_alligatormississipiensiship)**
*   **[Fourth trochanter](#13_alligatormississipiensisfemur) **on femur for m. caudofemoralis
*   Trend towards **[upright limb posture](#340_prestosuchuswhole)**

**Archosauriformes **(“first-lizard-form”) includes those archosauromorphs more derived than Prolacerta. These animals are distinguished by cranial synapomorphies and appendicular modifications towards more upright posture, including a perforated acetabulum, long, curved femora with a fourth trochanter for the caudofemoralis muscle, and a flexible **[“crocodile-reverse”](#11_erythrosuchusankle)** ankle.

“Thecodonts” are a waste-basket grade of early archosauriforms, and include animals like the sprawling Late Permian and Early Triassic **[Proterosuchidae](#348_proterosuchusfergusiskull)** (“earlier-crocodile”), the large, predatory **[Erythrosuchidae](#350_shansisuchusshansisuchuswhole),** and the crocodile-like **[Proterochampsids](#18_proterochampsabarrionuevoiskull)**. The most derived “thecodont” is **_[Euparkeria](#349_euparkeriacapensiswhole)_** (“good-Parker”), a cat-sized archosauriform with longer and more robust hindlimbs than any of its predecessors.

**[Phytosauria](#230_smilosuchusgregoriiskull)** (“plant-lizard”) is a clade of archosauriformes that occupied a primarily shallow-water predator ecology similar to extant crocodylians. Their elongate, **[toothy](#28_phytosauriateeth)** snouts resemble those of living piscivorous crocodylians like the gharial. However, we know that this longirostral morphology is convergent because crocodylians achieve long snouts by elongating their maxillae, while phytosaurs elongate their premaxillae and place their nares right in front of their eyes. Phytosaurs were once considered to fall within crown archosaurs as members of Pseudosuchia, but most recent phylogenetic analyses recover them as the sister group to Archosauria.


# 5.11 Archosauria


### (Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Absence of palatal teeth](#347_alligatorsinensiscranium)**

**Archosauria** (“first-lizard”) includes the most recent common ancestor of extant birds and crocodylians and all of that ancestor’s descendants. Archosauria splits into two lineages distinguished primarily by ankle morphology: the Avemetatarsalia, the group including those animals closer to and including birds, and the Pseudosuchia, or those animals closer to and including crocodylians. We will focus on the pseudosuchians for now, and save discussion of the bird line for labs 6 and 7.


# 5.12 Pseudosuchia


### (Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[‘Crocodile-normal’ ankle joint:](#90_typothoraxcoccinarumankle)** astragalus and calcaneum form peg and socket
*   **[Double row of paramedian osteoderms](#2_protosuchuswhole)**

Modern crocodylians are often considered ‘living fossils’ with highly conservative biology and anatomy, but much greater diversity is evident once you consider the total group, **Pseudosuchia**(“false-crocodile”). In fact, the earliest pseudosuchians were terrestrial herbivores!

The most basal pseudosuchians include the facultatively-bipedal **[Ornithosuchidae](#352_riojasuchusskull)**(“bird-crocodile”), which retain **[crocodile-reverse ankles](#63_riojasuchusankle)**, the tiny **_[Gracilisuchus](#9_gracilisuchusskull)_** (“slender-crocodile”), and the **[Aetosauria](#351_desmatosuchusspurensiswhole)** (“eagle-llizard”), which are widely distributed across Triassic Europe and the Americas. Members of this last clade are distinguished by their quadrupedal stance, large bodies, small heads, and extensive bony armor. This armor is composed of large plate-like osteoderm scutes, which overlap to cover the entire body.

Further crown-ward we find the **[Poposauroidea](#353_sillosuchuswhole)** and the **[Rauisuchidae](#340_prestosuchuswhole)**. These animals include specialized cursorial predators—in fact, within the shuvoasurid poposauroids we see animals very similar to ornithomimid dinosaurs, while the poposauroids and rauisuchids include large terrestrial predator ecomorphs that precede many of the carnivorous theropods that we will discuss in the next lab.


# 5.13 Crocodylomorpha


### (Late Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Simplified shoulder and wrist](#214_palaeosuchuspalpebrosushatchling)**
*   Trend towards **[smaller antorbital fenestra](#29_protosuchusskull)**
*   **[Amphicoelous vertebrae](#359_cyprinusvertebra)**

**Crocodylomorpha **(“crocodile-shape”) includes those pseudosuchians more closely related to extant crocodylians than the rauisuchians. The earliest members of this clade form a paraphyletic grade of animals known as [“sphenosuchians”](#354_terrestrisuchusreconstruction) (“wedge-crocodile”). These basal crocodylomorphs bear little resemblance to what you might consider a typical crocodylian, with many representatives possessing had elongate, gracile limbs that likely facilitated a cursorial lifestyle with obligate-erect quadrupedal posture.

**_[Protosuchus](#29_protosuchusskull)_** (“first-crocodile”) is a more derived crocodylomorph with a more stereotypically “crocodylian” set of features, including an ornamented skull, a flat skull roof, and elongated proximal carpals. However, Protosuchus retained the tall oreinirostral skull and erect limb posture ancestral to archosauriformes, instead of the flattened platyrostral skulls and derived sprawling gait of extant crocodylians.


# 5.14 Mesoeucrocodylia


### (Early Jurassic - Present)

Key Features



*   **[Partial secondary palate](#19_crocodilaemusrobustuswhole) with choanae in palatines**

This node includes those crocodylomorphs more closely related to extant crocodylians than _Protosuchus_. **Mesoeucrocodylians** (“middle-good-crocodile”) are very diverse, with open-ocean representatives as well as fascinating terrestrial animals that ‘scoop’ a number of mammalian ecomorphs.

**[Thalattosuchians](#357_steneosaurusslab)** (‘sea-crocodile’) are bizarre, **[longirostrine](#356_pelagosaurusskull)** oceangoing predators that take aquatic adaptations to the extreme. Members of this clade **[reduce their dermal armor](#358_steneosaurusosteoderms)** and lighten their endoskeletons for better buoyancy control, and propel themselves through the water with secondarily-derived hypocercal tails. **[Pholidosaurids](#19_crocodilaemusrobustuswhole)**(“scale-lizard”) are a related group of mesoeucrocodylians that retain a more conventionally crocodile-like morphology, but attained enormous body sizes.

**[Notosuchians](#355_notosuchuscranium)** (“back-crocodile”), on the other hand, are a terrestrial clade that occupy dietary niches ranging from obligate herbivory to hypercarnivory. Notosuchians are generally small-bodied, with skull shapes that diverge wildly from the standard ‘crocodile’ pattern, and more closely resemble modern-day birds and mammals.


# 5.15 Eusuchia


### (Early Cretaceous - Present)

Key Features



*   **[Complete secondary palate](#347_alligatorsinensiscranium) with choanae completely enclosed by pterygoids**
*   **[Antorbital fenestra lost](#347_alligatorsinensiscranium)**
*   **[Procoelous vertebrae](#10_alligatormississipiensisprocoelous)**
*   **[Osteoderms](#91_crocodylusrhombiferosteoderm) in [more than two longitudinal rows](#362_crocodyluswhole)**

This node exists mostly to unite **_[Isisfordia](#361_isisfordiaduncaniskull)_** with the crocodylian crown group, Crocodylia. **Eusuchia** (“good-crocodile”) marks the completion of the trend throughout the protosuchian and mesosuchian grades towards a complete bony secondary palate formed from the maxillae and the palatines, with the choanae/internal nares opening in the pterygoids, far back in the skull. This adaptation allows eusuchians, with their **longirostral** skulls, to breathe and eat at the same time.


# 5.16 Crocodylia


### (Cretaceous - Present)

**[Crocodylia](#363_crocodyluswhole2)** includes the ancestor of alligators, crocodiles, and gharials, and all of that ancestor’s descen- dants. There is some debate about interrelationships within this clade. Traditionally, the **Alligatoridae** and **Crocodylidae** have been considered sister groups. However, recent molecular analyses recover **Gavialidae** and Crocodylidae as sister groups.

**[Gavialidae](#213_gavialisgangeticusskull)** includes the Indian gharial (_Gavialis_) alongside many extinct forms. This lineage is character- ized by extremely slender and elongate snouts. Gavialids may be distinguished from other slender-snouted forms by their very small nasal bones. Slender snouts reflect an emphasis on speed of jaw motion rather than force production, and favor the muscles that attach to the supratemporal fenestra over the pterygoideus.

**[Alligatoridae](#364_alligatorandcrocodylusskulls)** includes those crocodylians more closely related to _Alligator_ than to _Crocodylus_. They tend to have broad snouts and, unlike crocodylids, possess a pit in their maxilla into which the 4th dentary tooth fits. Although alligatorids were once found in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, extant alligators are restricted to North America and Southeast Asia, while caimans are found only in South America.

The **[Crocodylidae](#364_alligatorandcrocodylusskulls)** are the ‘true’ crocodiles. Their 4th dentary tooth is visible through a lateral maxillary notch, even with the jaw closed. Crocodylids are found in freshwater and marine environments in and around Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Caribbean.
