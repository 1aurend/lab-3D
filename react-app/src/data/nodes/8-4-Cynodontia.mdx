**Cynodontia** (“dog-tooth”) is a stem-based clade that includes those species more closely related to Mammalia than to the therocephalian _Bauria_. The earliest cynodonts appear in the Late Permian as small-bodied forms like **_[Procynosuchus](#458_procynosuchuswhole)_**. Cynodonts feature **expanded dentaries** and **prominent zygomatic arches,** suggesting strong jaw adductor muscles. Their incipient **secondary palates**suggests that they may have been capable of suckling while breathing, while and the presence of small **cusps on their cheek teeth** may indicate the ability to chew.

**_[Thrinaxodon](#456_thrinaxodonandbroomistegaburrow)_** from the Early Triassic of South Africa is probably the best-known early cynodont. This animal is considered a good representative of the ancestral cynodont condition, and has been the focus of extensive research. One interesting feature of Thrinaxodon’s postcranial skeleton are the large posteriorly expanded costal plates on its ribs, which may have functioned in respiration or maintaining body rigidity.
