The **Theropoda** (“beast-foot”) are those dinosaurs closer to birds than to sauropods, and include many of the large carnivorous predators from the Mesozoic. Basal theropods include forms like **_[Eoraptor](#270_eoraptorlunensiswhole)_** and **_[Coelophysis.](#34_coelophysisskull)_**Many theropods from the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic were relatively small animals that retained many features of basal dinosauromorphs. Some basal theropods grew to larger sizes, like the crested ** _[Dilophosaurus,](#271_dilophosauruswhole)_ ** which was much larger in reality than the animal depicted in Jurassic Park. More derived theropods are grouped under **Neotheropoda,** which includes the horned, short-armed **ceratosaurs**like **_[Carnotaurus,](#272_carnotauruswhole)_** as well as the stiff-tailed **tetanurans.**

Theropods can be identified by their **pneumatized vertebrae and long bones,** the **intramandibular joint**between the angular/surangular and the dentary, and the **reduced digit V on the manus** (the pinky). Many also have **serrated teeth**  for cutting through flesh. In addition to the simiplification of the manus (hand), there is also a trend towards **[tridactyly in the pes](#35_coelophysisfoot)(foot).**
