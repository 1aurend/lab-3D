Extant **[Aves](#54_avesfeather)** (literally:“birds”) is divided into the **Palaeognathae,**which includes the flightless ratites (**[ostriches,](#149_struthiowhole)** **[cassowaries,](#304_casuariuscasuariuswhole)[kiwis,](#302_apteryxaustralisskull)**and allies) as well as the flying **[tinamous,](#303_tinamusmajorwhole)** and the **[Neognathae,](#53_gallinuloideswhole)** which includes all other living birds. Most avian synapomorphies are adaptations for weight reduction and flight. Birds tend to fuse bones (synsacrum, various long bones) and lose unneccesary structures (such as teeth). There are far too many birds to cover in this lab —you should check out the Ornithology course if you want to explore this diverse clade in full.
