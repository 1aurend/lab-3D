# 6.3 Ornithischia


### (Late Triassic - Late Cretaceous)


## Key Features



*   **[Caudally-oriented “bird-like” pubis](#55_othnielosauruswhole)** parallel to ischium, with prepubic process
*   **[Palpebral bone](#33_heterodontosaurusskull) **extends over orbit
*   **[Predentary bone](#119_protoceratopsskull)** rostral to dentary forms part of beak
*   **[“Leaf-shaped” tooth crowns expanded above root](#129_iguanodonteeth)**
*   **[Ossified tendons overlying sacrals](#45_tenontosaurustendons)**

The **Ornithischia** were a very diverse group, in which multiple lineages convergently evolved towards large body size and quadrupedality. The clade name (“bird-hip”) is a reference to the **caudal orientation of the pubis,** which slots up against the ischium. Note that while the ornithischian hip morphology is convergent on the bird condition, modern birds are actually members of the sister group Saurischia (“lizard- hip”). This adaptation is thought to have increased the volume of the abdominal cavity, creating extra space for breaking down plant matter via gut fermentation.

All ornithischians are thought to have beem at least partially herbivorous—their **predentary beaks** and **leaf-like teeth** reflect a browsing ecology. A novel ossification called the **palpebral** bone extends over the orbit; its exact function is unknown, but it may have protected the eye from sun or impacts. A bundle of **ossified tendons overlying the sacral vertebrae** is a synapomorphy of ornithischians, although these occur in some therpods as well.

A few basal ornithischians are known, including **_[Pisanosaurus](#221_pisanosaurusskeleton)_** (from the Late Triassic) and a group known as the **_[Heterodontisaurdae](#222_heterodontosaurustuckiskeleton)_** (Late Triassic - Early Cretaceous). These basal lineages were smaller than later forms, and retained an erect, bipedal posture. Interestingly, early ornithischians show some evidence of hair-like integumentary structures which may or may not be related to the feathers that emerge on the saurischian line.
