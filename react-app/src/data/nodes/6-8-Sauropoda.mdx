**Sauropoda** (“lizard-foot”) includes the giant **long-necked**dinosaurs and their closest relatives. Animals in this clade exhibit a trend towards quadrupedality and enormous body size, as well as columnar limbs to support their weight. The giant derived sauropods are familiar to many, but **Sauropodomorpha** also encompasses a paraphyletic grade of basal Late Triassic **[“Prosauropods”.](#32_sarahsaurusskull)**These animals are still bipedal and generally small-bodied, although some like **_[Plateosaurus](#262_plateosauruswhole)_** grew up to 9 meters long. They can be recognized by the presence of a large ungual on the thumb.

Sauropoda includes the largest terrestrial vertebrates to have ever lived, including the 100-ton, 40-meter Argentinosaurus. These animals were the dominant terrestrial herbivores, with incredibly long necks and relatively tiny skulls. Histological studies reveal that they grew quickly like birds, attaining their full size in 10-20 years. One of the best-known sauropod groups are the **[Diplodocoidea](#263_diplodocuswhole)**(“double-beam”), which include **_[Diplodocus](#131_diplodocusskull)_** and **_[Apatosaurus.](#264_apatosauruslouisaewhole)_** These animals are known from the Late Jurassic until the Cretaceous, and are characterized by elongate tails, short forelimbs, and square snouts with teeth only at the tip. Their nares tend to fuse together at the midline, but are smaller than those of the macronarians.

The **[Macronaria](#203_camarosaurusskull)** (“large-nostril”) are the most derived sauropod clade**.**These Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous dinosaurs are named for their enormous, dorsally-positioned nares, which are even larger than their orbits. Macronarians tend to have relatively longer forelimbs than the diplodocoids. Some macronarians lose the manual digits entirely, and stand on their metacarpals instead. This group includes animals like **[Camarasaurus,](#265_camarosauruswhole)** **[Brachiosaurus,](#266_brachiosauruswhole)** and the **[Titanosauridae.](#267_sarmientosaurusskull)** The validity of “Brontosaurus” was called into question when it was proposed that the type specimen was actually the skull of Camarasaurus on the body of Apatosaurus, but a more recent analysis has since resurrected the taxon.
