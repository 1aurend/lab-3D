The other saurian lineage are the **Archosauromorpha** (“first-lizard-shape”), those animals more closely related to birds and crocodylians than to lepidosaurs. This includes a series of basal lineages that mostly form a series of progressive outgroups to more derived clades. The most basal group are the **Protorosauria,**  which are known from the Late Permian to the Late Triassic. They are an unusual group including many animals with long necks, like **_[Macrocnemus](#341_macrocnemuswhole),_**the **[tanystropheids](#342_tanystropheuswhole)** and the odd, arboreal **[drepanosaurs](#343_megalancosauruspreonensiswhole),**which resembled chameleons with bird-like heads.

The massive, beaked **[Rhynchosauria](#344_rhynchosaurusarticepsskull)** (“beak-lizard”) **** were herbivores common in the Triassic, and possessed rows of teeth on the maxilla, dentary, and palatine, an unusual style of jaw occlusion, and a well-developed sagittal crest on their large heads.

The likely sister taxon to archosauriformes is **_[Prolacerta](#345_prolacertabroomiskull)_**(“before-lizard”), known from the Late Permian to Early Triassic of Antarctica and South Africa. This animal superficially resembles modern lizards, but its long snout, narrow skull, and recurved teeth align it instead with the archosauriformes.
