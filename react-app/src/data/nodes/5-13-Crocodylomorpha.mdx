# 5.13 Crocodylomorpha


### (Late Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Simplified shoulder and wrist](#214_palaeosuchuspalpebrosushatchling)**
*   Trend towards **[smaller antorbital fenestra](#29_protosuchusskull)**
*   **[Amphicoelous vertebrae](#359_cyprinusvertebra)**

**Crocodylomorpha **(“crocodile-shape”) includes those pseudosuchians more closely related to extant crocodylians than the rauisuchians. The earliest members of this clade form a paraphyletic grade of animals known as [“sphenosuchians”](#354_terrestrisuchusreconstruction) (“wedge-crocodile”). These basal crocodylomorphs bear little resemblance to what you might consider a typical crocodylian, with many representatives possessing had elongate, gracile limbs that likely facilitated a cursorial lifestyle with obligate-erect quadrupedal posture.

**_[Protosuchus](#29_protosuchusskull)_** (“first-crocodile”) is a more derived crocodylomorph with a more stereotypically “crocodylian” set of features, including an ornamented skull, a flat skull roof, and elongated proximal carpals. However, Protosuchus retained the tall oreinirostral skull and erect limb posture ancestral to archosauriformes, instead of the flattened platyrostral skulls and derived sprawling gait of extant crocodylians.
