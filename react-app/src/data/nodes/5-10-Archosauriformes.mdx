## Key Features



*   **[Antorbital and mandibular fenestrae](#340_prestosuchuswhole)**
*   **[Thecodont teeth](#347_alligatorsinensiscranium)**
*   **[Acetabular foramen](#12_alligatormississipiensiship)**
*   **[Fourth trochanter](#13_alligatormississipiensisfemur) **on femur for m. caudofemoralis
*   Trend towards **[upright limb posture](#340_prestosuchuswhole)**

**Archosauriformes **(“first-lizard-form”) includes those archosauromorphs more derived than Prolacerta. These animals are distinguished by cranial synapomorphies and appendicular modifications towards more upright posture, including a perforated acetabulum, long, curved femora with a fourth trochanter for the caudofemoralis muscle, and a flexible **[“crocodile-reverse”](#11_erythrosuchusankle)** ankle.

“Thecodonts” are a waste-basket grade of early archosauriforms, and include animals like the sprawling Late Permian and Early Triassic **[Proterosuchidae](#348_proterosuchusfergusiskull)** (“earlier-crocodile”), the large, predatory **[Erythrosuchidae](#350_shansisuchusshansisuchuswhole),** and the crocodile-like **[Proterochampsids](#18_proterochampsabarrionuevoiskull)**. The most derived “thecodont” is **_[Euparkeria](#349_euparkeriacapensiswhole)_** (“good-Parker”), a cat-sized archosauriform with longer and more robust hindlimbs than any of its predecessors.

**[Phytosauria](#230_smilosuchusgregoriiskull)** (“plant-lizard”) is a clade of archosauriformes that occupied a primarily shallow-water predator ecology similar to extant crocodylians. Their elongate, **[toothy](#28_phytosauriateeth)** snouts resemble those of living piscivorous crocodylians like the gharial. However, we know that this longirostral morphology is convergent because crocodylians achieve long snouts by elongating their maxillae, while phytosaurs elongate their premaxillae and place their nares right in front of their eyes. Phytosaurs were once considered to fall within crown archosaurs as members of Pseudosuchia, but most recent phylogenetic analyses recover them as the sister group to Archosauria.
