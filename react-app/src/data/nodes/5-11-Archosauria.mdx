**Archosauria** (“first-lizard”) includes the most recent common ancestor of extant birds and crocodylians and all of that ancestor’s descendants. Archosauria splits into two lineages distinguished primarily by ankle morphology: the Avemetatarsalia, the group including those animals closer to and including birds, and the Pseudosuchia, or those animals closer to and including crocodylians. We will focus on the pseudosuchians for now, and save discussion of the bird line for labs 6 and 7.
