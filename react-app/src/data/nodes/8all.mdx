# 8.1 Synapsida


### (Pennsylvanian - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Lateral temporal fenestra](#97_dimetrodonlimbatusskull)**
*   At least **[2 sacral ribs](#421_caseabroiliipostcrania)**
*   **[Robust limbs](#423_caseabroiliiwhole)**
*   **[Short metapodials](#424_caseametapodials)**
*   **[Reduced fusion of girdle elements](#429_ophiacodonpelvis)**

**Synapsida** (“together-arch”) is defined as a stem group including those amniotes more closely related to extant mammals than to sauropsids. The clade is named for the presence of a single opening posterior to the orbit, the[ lateral temporal fenestra.](#97_dimetrodonlimbatusskull) **** This structure is sometimes referred to as an infratemporal fenestra, but we avoid that terminology since the synapsid fenestra is is convergent on the infratemporal fenestra in diapsids, rather than homologous to it). Synapsidaincludes several extinct groups in addition to mammals, including a basal, paraphyletic assemblage known as the **“pelycosaurs”**(“basin-lizard”).

The **Caseasauria** include two groups, the **[Caseidae](#423_caseabroiliiwhole)** and the **[Eothyrididae](#427_eothyrisskull)**(“dawn-shield”). Both are distinguished by their low, broad skulls and pointed snouts. Although considered basal synapsids, caseasaurs do not appear in the fossil record until the Early Permian. The **[caseids](#426_caseaskull)** were heavily-built, barrel-shaped herbivores that ranged up to five meters in length, but had comically tiny heads. Their skulls have a **pineal foramen, greatly expanded external nares,**and **cusped dentition** . They are known from the Early and Middle Permian of Russia, Europe, and North America. Meanwhile, the small-bodied **eothyridids** are known only from cranial material found in North American Permian rock.

The **[Ophiacodontidae](#71_ophiacodonverts)** (“serpent-tooth”) are the first synapsids to appear in the fossil record, emerging in the Pennsylvanian of North America and Europe and persisting until the Early Permian. The group includes the oldest synapsid fossil known, a partial skeleton of **_[Archaeothyris](#428_archaeothyrisflorensisskull)_** from the Morien Group of Nova Scotia. The type species of this clade, **_Ophiacodon_**, is between 1.5 and 4 meters long, much larger than most other amniotes of its time. Its **long, deep skull** and **wide, toothy gape** points to a predatory ecology, while its **[tall, broad neural spines](#71_ophiacodonverts)** likely supported extensive axial musculature for terrestrial locomotion.  The lateral temporal fenestra and orbit are both small, and positioned high up and posteriorly in the skull.

The **Varanopidae** (“varanid-face”) are smaller than the ophiacodontids, and carnivorous. Although some material is known from the Late Carboniferous of North America and the Middle Permian of Russia and South Africa, most specimens are from the Early Permian of North America. Varanopids have long, lightly built limbs that suggest an active, terrestrial, predatory lifestyle. As exemplified by **_[Varanops](#431_varanopsbrevirostriswhole)_**, the members of this clade have long, slender snouts, slimmer than those of ophiacodontids and with dentition extending much further posterior in the jaw.

The **[Edaphosauridae](#432_edaphosauruspogoniaswhole)** (“floor-lizard”) are among the oldest synapsids in the fossil record, appearing in the late Pennsyl- vanian and persisting until the end of the Early Permian, primarily in North America. Edaphosaurids are easily identified by their **[elongated neural spines,](#73_edaphosaurusspine)**which are circular in cross-section and are studded with small transverse bars or knobs. These neural spines are thought to have been covered by skin, forming a large **sail**. Like most edaphosaurids, **_Edaphosaurus_** is thought to have been herbivorous, with its large, barrel-shaped body, small head, and reduced marginal dentition supplemented by **[numerous small denticles](#433_edaphosaurusdenticles)** on the palatines, pterygoids, and ectopterygoids. Further evidence of herbivory is given by the position of the jaw articulation below the level of the tooth row, and a jaw joint that facilitates anterior-posterior motion.

The **[Sphenacodontidae](#97_dimetrodonlimbatusskull)** (“wedge-point-tooth”) were large-bodied apex predators known from the Late Pennsylvanian to the Middle Permian. This clade includes **_[Sphenacodon](#434_sphenacodonferoxwhole)_** and **_[Dimetrodon](#435_dimetrodonwhole)_**, the iconic ‘not-dinosaur’ from gift shops and children’s books. Sphenacodontids are distinguished by their **large skulls** and **serrated ziphodont teeth.**Several features identify them as more closely related to the Therapsida than edaphosaurids, including **[differentiated canine teeth](#438_dimetrodonanderyopsskulls),[contact between the maxilla and the nasal](#437_sphenacodonferoxskulldiagram),** and **a reflected lamina of the angular.** As with the edaphosaurids, the precise function of the sphenacodontid sail remains a mystery, although various researchers have proposed that it may have functioned as a muscle attachment, in intraspecific signaling, or as a thermoregulatory device.

# 8.2 Therapsida


### (Early Permian - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Differentiated dentition](#312_inostranceviaalexandriskull),** with incisors, canines, and postcanines
*   **[Enlarged dentary, reduced postdentary bones](#446_dicynodonsections)**
*   **[Contact between the maxilla and the nasal](#446_dicynodonsections)**
*   **[Trend towards parasagittal limb posture](#447_biarmosuchustenerparasagittal)**
*   **[Limbs have greater range of motion](#447_biarmosuchustenerparasagittal)**

**Therapsida** (“beast-arch”) includes those synapsids more closely related to extant mammals than the sphenacodontidae. One of the most basal therapsid lineages is the **[Biarmosuchia](#441_biarmosuchustenerwhole)**(“Bjarmaland-crocodile”), from the Middle and Late Permian of Russia, South Africa, and China. Most biarmosuchians are thought to have been small carnivores. They are generally similar to sphenacodontids, but possess a reduced pectoral girdle, longer, more gracile limbs, and more open temporal fenestrae.

More-derived therapsids include the **Dinocephalia,** the **Anomodontia,** and the **Theriodonta**. **Dinocephalians**(“terrible-head”) are known only from the Middle Permian of Russia and South Africa, and can be recognized from their **interlocking dentition.** This group diversified very rapidly, with over 40 genera currently recognized, and filled both large predator and herbivore niches. Even though these species were major components of Middle Permian ecosystems, they all went extinct and were replaced by more derived gorgonopsians and dicynodonts in the Late Periman. The **[anteosaurids](#443_titanophoneuswhole)** and the **[titanosuchids](#442_jonkeriaskull)**were large carnivores, with short limbs, heavily-built skulls, and well-developed incisors and canines. The herbivorous **[tapinocephalids](#444_moschopscapensiswhole)** were a sight to behold, weighing up to two tons, with **deep bodies, shoulders higher than their hips,**  and **thick, domed, downward-pointing skulls.**

**Anomodontia** (“unusual-tooth”) is a cosmopolitan clade from the Late Permian to Late Triassic, which includes the diverse **Dicynodontia** and close relatives. All anomodonts appear to have been facultative or obligate herbivores. **_[Suminia](#448_suminiaskull),_** a basal anomodont from the Late Permian, has a short snout and differentiated teeth for herbivory, but also long limbs with grasping hands and feet. It has been posited to be the oldest known arboreal (tree-living) tetrapod.

**[Dicynodonts](#69_dinodontosaurusverts)** (“two-dog-tooth”) were an incredibly successful clade, potentially the most diverse group of non-mammalian synapsids with over 60 genera currently recognized. The members of this clade were the dominant herbivores in Late Permian ecosystems, and are commonly found at fossil localities. Dicynodonts are clearly recognizable by their **[short, stocky bodies, powerful forelimbs,](#422_ischigualastiawhole)[absent anterior teeth, prominent canine tusks, large adductor chambers,](#70_dinodontosaurusskull)**and **keratinous beaks**. The presence of a large retroarticular process on the mandible and a specialized “roller-like” articular surface suggest that the jaws allowed **propalinal movement**for processing vegetation, rather than just opening and closing. Although most species were terrestrial herbivores, some became specialized for fossorial lifestyles, excavating burrows and digging for buried food. Ranging in mass from rat-sized to hippo-sized, dicynodonts were one of the few groups to survive the Permo-Triassic mass extinction, but their numbers still dipped significantly. They were once again widespread by the Mid-Triassic, but would eventually go extinct at the end of the Triassic.

# 8.3 Theriodontia


### (Late Permian - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Coronoid process on enlarged dentary](#449_gorynychusmasyutinaeskull)**
*   **[Snout broader than deep](#312_inostranceviaalexandriskull)**

**Theriodontia** (“beast-tooth”) is a node-based clade that includes the most recent common ancestor of **Gorgonopsia** and extant mammals, and all of that ancestor’s descendants. In addition to the gorgonopsians, this clade also includes the **Therocephalia** and the **Cynodontia** (including mammals). Theriodonts share several features of the skull with extant mammals, most notably **[strongly-differentiated dentition](#451_bauriaskull),[a broader snout](#450_moschorhinusskull),**and a **[coronoid process of the dentary](#449_gorynychusmasyutinaeskull)** for muscle attachment. Along with the dicynodonts, the therocephalians and the cynodonts are the only three synapsid lineages to survive the Permian-Triassic extinction.

The **[Gorgonopsia](#312_inostranceviaalexandriskull)**(“terrible-face”) were medium to large carnivores that dominated Late Permian ecosystems. Their **[gracile postcranial skeletons](#454_inostranceviaalexandriwhole)**suggest that the gorgonopsians may have been capable of rapid locomotion while pursuing prey. Studies of cranial anatomy have revealed powerful jaws with very large gapes (up to 90°), allowing the use of **[enlarged, serrated canines](#439_smilesaurusferoxskull)** for killing prey. These specialized saber teeth were so long that some gorgonopsians developed a trough on their dentaries to protect them, giving their faces a distinctive, blunt appearance shared with later saber-toothed predators.

Sister to the Cynodontia were the **[Therocephalia](#453_moschorhinuskitchingiskull)**(“beast-head”), known from the Middle Permian to the Middle Triassic. While not as diverse as some other therapsid clades, therocephalians nevertheless exhibited a range of forms, including small insectivores, large carnivores, and even herbivores in the Early Triassic. Therocephalians can be recognized by their **enlarged temporal fenestrae, enlarged canines, wide, ridged teeth, and reduced phalanx count.**

# 8.4 Cynodontia


### (Late Permian - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Masseteric fossa on dentary](#316_thrinaxodonliorhinusskull)**
*   **[Multicusped postcanine (cheek) teeth](#316_thrinaxodonliorhinusskull)**
*   **[Double occipital condyles](#316_thrinaxodonliorhinusskull)**
*   **[Reflected lamina of the angular greatly reduced](#316_thrinaxodonliorhinusskull)**
*   Trend towards **[bony secondary palate](#14_pascualgnathuspolanskiiskull)**
*   **[Regionalization of dorsal vertebrae](#457_thrinaxodonliorhinuswhole) **(thoracic and lumbar)
*   **[Ilium expanded anteriorly](#457_thrinaxodonliorhinuswhole)**

**Cynodontia** (“dog-tooth”) is a stem-based clade that includes those species more closely related to Mammalia than to the therocephalian _Bauria_. The earliest cynodonts appear in the Late Permian as small-bodied forms like **_[Procynosuchus](#458_procynosuchuswhole)_**. Cynodonts feature **expanded dentaries** and **prominent zygomatic arches,** suggesting strong jaw adductor muscles. Their incipient **secondary palates**suggests that they may have been capable of suckling while breathing, while and the presence of small **cusps on their cheek teeth** may indicate the ability to chew.

**_[Thrinaxodon](#457_thrinaxodonliorhinuswhole)_** from the Early Triassic of South Africa is probably the best-known early cynodont. This animal is considered a good representative of the ancestral cynodont condition, and has been the focus of extensive research. One interesting feature of Thrinaxodon’s postcranial skeleton are the large posteriorly expanded costal plates on its ribs, which may have functioned in respiration or maintaining body rigidity.

# 8.5 Eucynodontia


### (Early Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Very enlarged dentary approaches jaw joint](#313_probelesodonsanjuanensisskull)**
*   **[Postdentary bones of the lower jaw are small and rod-like](#76_massetognathusteruggiipostdentarybones)**

**Eucynodontia** (“good-dog-tooth”) unites the two great derived cynodont clades: the **Cynognathia** and the **Probainognathia**. Eucynodonts are characterized by an **extremely enlarged dentary**making up most of the length of the mandible, and **greatly-reduced, rodlike postdentary bones** that fit inside a groove on the lingual side of the dentary. The Eucynodontia radiated extensively in the Early/Middle Triassic as both carnivorous and herbivorous forms.



---



# 8.6 Cynognathia


### (Early Triassic - Late Triassic)

Key Features



*   **[Very deep zygomatic arch](#317_diademodontetragonusskull)**

**Cynognathia** (“dog-jaw”) is defined as the least-inclusive clade including **_[Exaeretodon](#459_exaeretodonwhole)_** and excluding _Probainognathus_. This group includes the carnivorous **Cynognathidae** and the herbivorous **Gomphodontia,**and is characterized by a **deep zygomatic arch** and **diverse tooth morphologies.**

The **[Cynognathidae](#460_cynognathusskull)** retained the carnivorous lifestyle ancestral to cynodonts; many of their cheek teeth preserve wear from chewing meat, indicating both carnivory and mastication. This clade persisted until the Middle Triassic before going extinct.

The **Gomphodontia** (“peg-tooth”) comprise the Early and Middle Triassic **[Diademondontidae](#317_diademodontetragonusskull)**(“band-tooth”), and the **[Traversodontidae](#455_pascualgnathuspolanskiiwholeskull)** (“across-tooth”), which survived until the end of the Triassic. These herbivorous animals featured **precise tooth occlusion**  and often **propalinal jaw motion,** likely for shearing plant matte rbetween their cheek teeth. The traversodontids were quite successful, with over 20 species known from the Middle and Late Triassic.

# 8.7 Probainognathia


### (Middle Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Secondary palate extends to posterior cheek teeth](#313_probelesodonsanjuanensisskull)**
*   **[Pineal foramen lost](#318_probainognathusskull)**
*   **[Differentiated superficial masseter muscle](#313_probelesodonsanjuanensisskull)**
*   **[Secondary jaw joint](#318_probainognathusskull)**

The **Probainognathia** (“progressive-jaw”) are those animals more closely related to Mammalia than to Cynognathia. There are five clades of probainognathians, four of which form progessive outgroups to the Mammaliaformes: the **Chiniquodontidae, Probainognathidae, Tritheledontidae,** and **Tritylodontidae.** Beginning with the probainognathians, cynodonts along the mammalian lineage feature a derived, **secondary dentary-squamosal jaw articulation** in addition to the plesiomorphic **quadrate-articular articulation.** The quadrate and articular will eventually lose their role in the jaw joint entirely and migrate to the middle ear, where they are known as the incus and malleus respectively. There is also some evidence that the very **first whiskers**  may have evolved at this node.

# 8.8 Mammaliamorpha


### (Late Triassic - Present)

**Mammaliamorpha** (“mammal-shape”) is a node-based clade that unites the most derived non-mammaliaform cynodonts with the **Mammaliaformes**. ****

The possibly-paraphyletic **tritheledontids** are best known from the Early Jurassic, but range from the Late Triassic into the Middle Jurassic. These small to medium-sized carnivorous or insectivorous animals lived in South America and South Africa.

**[Tritylodontids,](#75_kayentatheriumwellesiskull)** from the Late Triassic to Jurassic, are often recovered as the sister-group of Mammali- formes. Members of this clade have **enlarged incisors,** **a diastema**(gap in anterior dentition), and **reduced canines**, but still lack many derived mammaliaform features.
