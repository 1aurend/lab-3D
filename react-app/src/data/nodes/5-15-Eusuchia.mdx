# 5.15 Eusuchia


### (Early Cretaceous - Present)

Key Features



*   **[Complete secondary palate](#347_alligatorsinensiscranium) with choanae completely enclosed by pterygoids**
*   **[Antorbital fenestra lost](#347_alligatorsinensiscranium)**
*   **[Procoelous vertebrae](#10_alligatormississipiensisprocoelous)**
*   **[Osteoderms](#91_crocodylusrhombiferosteoderm) in [more than two longitudinal rows](#362_crocodyluswhole)**

This node exists mostly to unite **_[Isisfordia](#361_isisfordiaduncaniskull)_** with the crocodylian crown group, Crocodylia. **Eusuchia** (“good-crocodile”) marks the completion of the trend throughout the protosuchian and mesosuchian grades towards a complete bony secondary palate formed from the maxillae and the palatines, with the choanae/internal nares opening in the pterygoids, far back in the skull. This adaptation allows eusuchians, with their **longirostral** skulls, to breathe and eat at the same time.
