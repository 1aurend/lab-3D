# 6.5 Marginocephalia


### (Late Jurassic - Late Cretaceous)


## Key Features



*   **[Skull shelf](#238_triceratopshorridusskull)** formed by fusion of parietals and squamosals
*   **[Reduced pubis](#226_psittacosauruswhole) **(prepubic process retained)
*   **[Reduced premaxilla contribution to palate](#238_triceratopshorridusskull)**

**Marginocephalia** includes the “dome-headed” Pachycephalosauria and the frilled Ceratopsia. This group is united by the presence of fused parietals and squamosals, creating a defined margin along the back of the skull.

The **[Pachycephalosauria](#220_pachycephalosauruswyomingensis)** (“thick-head-lizard”) are known only from the Cretaceous and have a **[distinctive, thickened skull roof,](#239_stegocerasvalidumskull)**which is sometimes ornamented with bony bulbs and spikes. The function of the thick skulls is not completely understood: some evidence suggests competitive head-butting, but other studies suggest that the forces involved would have killed the animals. What is known is that the skulls show complex ontogeny, with horns and bumps appearing early in life before fusing to form the full dome. Unlike derived ceratopsians, pachycephalosaurs retain bipedality. They can also be identified by the reduced pubic contribution to their acetabulum.

The **[Ceratopsia](#126_triceratopswhole)** (“horn-face”) are a charismatic group known from the Late Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous. Ceratopsians can be recognized by the rostral bone at the end of their premaxilla, which forms the base of a large, plant-cropping beak. They also feature distinctive ** flared jugals ** for muscle attachment. In addition to the beak, these herbivorous animals have long rows of shearing teeth for processing vegetation. The derived **Ceratopsidae,**such as **_[Triceratops](#244_triceratopswhole)_** and **_[Styracosaurus,](#243_styracosaurusskull)_** were large, quadrupedal animals with spectacular cranial horns and frills, while basal ceratopsians like **_[Psittacosaurus](#242_psittacosaurusskull)_** were bipedal and frill-less. Interestingly, _Psittacosaurus_ has been found preserved with[ long bristles ](#241_psittacosaurusbristles)that may or may not be homologous with feathers. If _Psittacosaurus’_ bristles are indeed proto-feathers, that would make feathers plesiomorphic for dinosaurs as a whole, not just theropods. **_[Protoceratops](#240_protoceratopsandrewsiwhole)_** is known from the Late Cretaceous of Asia and is still relatively small, but likely partially quadrupedal. _Protoceratops_ shows a developed skull frill and incipient facial horns, as well as closely-spaced shearing teeth.
