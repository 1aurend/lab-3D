# 5.3 Sauropsida


### (Middle Permian - Present)

**Sauropsida** (“lizard-arch”) is the lineage that includes all amniotes more closely related to turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodylians, and birds than to mammals. One of the first major groups are the **Parareptilia,** sauropsids that were thought by some to be related to turtles. Regardless of their true affinities, we will save our discussion of these animals for Lab 7 due to their historical significance to our understanding of turtle evolution.

**[Captorhinids](#31_captorhinusskull)** (“snatching-snout”) were small Permian animals with large, textured, heart-shaped skulls. They used their multiple rows of peglike teeth for grinding either plants or hard shells. The Late Carboniferous **Romeriids,**such as **_[Romeria](#5_romeriaskull)_** and **_[Protorothyris](#27_protorothyrisverts)_**, are well-known for being found in fossilized tree stumps.
