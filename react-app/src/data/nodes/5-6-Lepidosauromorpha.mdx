**Lepidosauromorpha** (“scale-lizard-shape”) are those saurians closer to (and including) living lizards and snakes than to crocodylians and birds. There are a few known stem lepidosaurs, but the fossil record outside the crown is rather incomplete. Some early-diverging examples are **_[Palaeagama](#321_palaeagamawhole)_** and the Early Triassic **_[Sophineta](#323_sophinetacracoviensisskull)_**.

All lepidosauromorphs feature a **quadrate conch** (you will also see this referred to as a laterally-embayed quadrate) superficially resembling a human external ear. An **entepicondylar foramen** on the medial side of the distal end of the humerus gives passage to a neurovascular bundle, although the presence of this structure is rather variable in extant lepidosaurs.

While dental implantation varies within crown lepidosaurs, the plesiomorphic lepidosauromorph condition is **[pleurodonty](#325_cycluracycluraskull)**(“side-tooth”)**,** where continuously-replaced teeth are attached to the medial, or lingual, surface of the jaw. The **acrodont** (“end-/top-tooth”) condition, where teeth are attached directly to the ridge at the apex of the jawbone, is found in **_[Sphenodon](#202_sphenodonskull),_[chameleons](#200_chameleondilepisskull),**and **[agamid iguanians](#207_agamastellioskull),**while the socketed archosaurian **thecodont** (“capsule-tooth”) condition is found in **[mosasaurs](#324_prognathodontooth)** and **[snakes](#177_pythonamethystinusskull)**(although some refer to the shallow-socketed teeth in these animals as **“subthecodont”**, and consider them distinct from the deep-socketed true thecodont condition).
