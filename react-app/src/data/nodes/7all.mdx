# 7.1 Pterosauria


### (Late Triassic - End Cretaceous)


## Key Features



*   **[Elongated digit IV forming wing ](#366_anhanguerapiscatorwhole)**
*   **[Actinofibrils in wing membrane](#370_rhamphorhynchusmuensteriactinofibrils)**
*   **[Pteroid bone in wrist](#369_phosphatodracowhole)**
*   **[Pneumatic bones ](#367_anhanguerasantanaepneumatic)**
*   **Vertebrae fused into [synsacrum and notarium](#369_phosphatodracowhole)**

The birds, the bats, and the **Pterosauria** (‘wing-lizard’) are the three groups of vertebrates to have evolved powered flight. Triassic Pterosaurs most likely beat everyone else into the air, since the **[first avialan theropods](#372_archaeopteryxlithographicalagerstatten)** arrive in the Late Jurassic and **[bats do not appear until the Cenozoic.](#371_icaronycterisbat)**  The pterosaurs are the sister group to the Dinosauromorpha, meaning that the avemetatarsalian archosaurs evolved flight twice!

Unlike bats, which evolve a wing membrane **(patagium)**stretched between all five manual digits, and birds, in which the wing skeleton supports a large lifting area made up of feathers, the **[pterosaur wing](#373_batbirdpterodactylwing)**is composed of a posterior **brachiopatagium** stretched between the body and the **elongated fourth finger,** and an anterior **propatagium** supported by a mobile **pteroid** (modified carpal) bone. A smaller **uropatagium**spans the gap between each foot and the tail. Since even the most basal pterosaurs (like the Late Triassic **_[Eudimorphodon](#374_eudimorphodonwhole)_**) already have all the anatomical features associated with flight, the sequence of changes leading to volancy in this lineage are unclear. Pterosaurs are thought to have evolved from a bipedal ancestor, but evidence from trackways shows that most of them walked quadrupedally, using their feet and their first three manual digits. Like derived theropods, pterosaurs have **hollow bones** to reduce weight. Their bodies are often comically small relative to their heads, with axial modifications like a fused **synsacrum** (convergent on the bird condition) and several dorsal vertebrae fused into a **notarium.** Their patagia were supported by stiff **actinofibrils,** and some forms had dense **[pycnofibers](#375_sordespilosuspycnofibers)** covering the body, likely for thermoregulation at high altitudes .

There are two major groups of pterosaurs, the likely paraphyletic **[“Rhamphorhynchoidea”](#376_raeticodactylusanimation)** (“beak-snout”) and the monophyletic **[Pterodactyloidea](#369_phosphatodracowhole)** (“wing-finger”). Basal pterosaurs like **_[Rhamphorhynchus](#370_rhamphorhynchusmuensteriactinofibrils)_** retain many plesiomorphic characters, like long, vaned tailes, an elongated pedal digit V supporting the uropatagium, short necks, and toothy jaws, and were found primarily in the Jurassic. The Pterodactyloidea (named after **_[Pterodactylus,](#16_pterodactyluslongirostriswhole)_** which, incidentally, was described in 1784 as an **[aquatic animal](#377_pterodactylusaquatic)**) appear in the Late Jurassic and can be distinguished from other pterosaurs by their longer necks, reduced tails, and larger body size. Some pterodactyloids lose their teeth (e.g., **_[Pteranodon](#378_pteranodonskull)_**) while others modify their teeth into sieves for straining prey from water (e.g., **_[Ctenochasma](#379_ctenochasmaskull)_**). Many evolve **[elaborate cranial crests,](#380_tupandactyluscrest)** the function of which is still unclear.


# 7.2 Mesosauria


### (Early Permian - Late Permian)

The **[Mesosauria](#381_mesosauruswhole)** (‘middle-lizard’) were relatively small, aquatic animals with **large, webbed hind feet**and **long, laterally-compressed tails** for swimming. Further evidence of their aquatic lifestyle can be seen in their dense, **[pachyostotic ribs,](#62_mesosauruswhole)** which would have aided in buoyancy control. Pachyostosis (‘thick-bone’) is a common feature in many of the other aquatic groups in this lab. The first amniotes did not start venturing out onto land until the Carboniferous, making the Early Permian mesosaurs the first secondarily-aquatic amniotes. Despite their single infratemporal fenestra, mesosaurs were either basal sauropsids or basal parareptiles, rather than members of Diapsida or Synapsida.


# 7.3 Ichthyopterygia


### (Early Triassic - Late Cretaceous)


## Key Features



*   **[Very large orbit with sclerotic ring](#385_ichthyosaurskull)**
*   **[Amphicoelous,](#384_ichthyosauramphicoelous)** disc-shaped **[“ashtray” vertebrae,](#387_ichthyosaurusconybeariwhole)** lacking transverse processes and zygapophyses
*   **[Dorsal fin](#388_ichthyosaurdorsalfin)** and **[lunate, hypocercal caudal fin](#387_ichthyosaurusconybeariwhole)**for axial swimming
*   **Paddle-like limbs** with **[hyperphalangy](#382_ichthyosaurpaddle)** and **[hyperdactyly](#386_ichthyosaurusanningaeslab)**

The **[Ichthyopterygia](#386_ichthyosaurusanningaeslab)** (‘fish-wing’) are a group of marine reptiles found throughout most of the Mesozoic, with a body shape convergent on modern dolphins. Their derived anatomy has made it difficult to determine their phylogenetic position—they were definitely diapsids, but it is unclear whether they were a stem lineage or if they belonged to either Lepidosauromorpha or Archosauromorpha.

Ichthyopterygians were entirely adapted to life in the water, giving birth to live young **[(viviparity)](#389_chaohusaurusviviparity)**and using their limbs to steer while propelling themselves with their vertebral columns and tails. Basal forms were very recognizable as ‘reptiles’, but derived members of the lineage evolved progressively more fusiform (streamlined, tapering) bodies and **hypocercal caudal fins,** as revealed by **[fossilized body impressions.](#388_ichthyosaurdorsalfin)**Their **reduced pelvic limbs** often lack any connection to the vertebral column. The large, stiff, **paddle- shaped forelimbs** are composed of multiple **disc-shaped elements,** and lack any mobile joints distal to the glenoid fossa. Some lineages exhibit **hyperdactyly** (extra digits), and all but the most basal animals show **hyperphalagy** (extra phalanges per digit). Ichthyopterygian skulls are very distinctive, with **toothy, elongated rostrums** and **enlarged orbits.** Many derived forms have truly enormous orbits, which, together with the sclerotic rings with which they are often found, may be indicative of an ability to dive to incredible depths.


# 7.4 Sauropterygia


### (Late Triassic - Late Cretaceous)


## Key Features



*   Large premaxilla forms **[snout anterior to external nares](#58_dolichorhynchopsskull)**
*   **[Synaptosaurid skull](#396_plesiosaurusmacrocephalusskull)** with a single temporal fenestra

The **Sauropterygia** (‘lizard-wing’) are another Mesozoic clade of marine diapsids (possibly lepidosauro- morphs or archosauromorphs). The first and most basal group are the Mid to Late Triassic **[Placodontia](#390_placodusgigaswhole)** (‘tablet-tooth’). These animals are named for the **[plate-like crushing dentition](#391_cyamodusdentition)** on their jaw margin and palate, which they likely used to eat hard-shelled invertebrates. Placodonts swam through shallow coastal waters with their **paddle-shaped limbs, laterally-compressed tails,** and **pachyostotic ribs.** Some placodonts actually had a shell that superficially resembled a turtle carapace, but was **[made entirely out of osteoderms.](#392_psephodermaosteoderms)**

The other two sauropterygian groups form a clade. The **[Nothosauria](#56_pachypleurosauruswhole)** lived in shallow coastal waters during the Middle Triassic and can be recognized by their **elongated necks, protruding recumbent teeth, pachyostotic ribs,** and **[webbed, oar-like limbs.](#393_nothosaurusvarious)** Nothosaurians ranged from 20cm to 4m in length and included the true **[nothosaurs](#394_nothosauruswhole)** and the smaller, basal pachypleurosaurs.

The **Plesiosauria** are the best-known group of sauropterygians, and include two main lineages: the **[Pliosauroidea](#395_liopleurodonferoxwhole)** (’more-lizard’) and the **[Plesiosauroidea](#398_plesiosaurwhole)** (’near-lizard’). The plesiosauroids had **small skulls and long necks** (think ‘Loch Ness Monster’) while the pliosauroids had **large skulls and short necks.** Plesiosaurs originated at the Triassic/Jurassic boundary, and were dominant in oceans worldwide until the Late Cretaceous. Like ichthyosaurs, they were **[viviparous](#399_polycotyluswithfetus)**. Plesiosauroids are thought to have used their long necks and **[peg-like teeth](#396_plesiosaurusmacrocephalusskull)** to ambush smaller fish or squid, while the pliosauroids were likely fast-moving pursuit predators that dove to great depths to take large-bodied prey with their **[giant, conical teeth.](#401_pliosauruscarpenteriskull)**

The plesiosaurs were heavily modified for aquatic locomotion. Their **[expanded, ventrally-positioned girdles](#398_plesiosaurwhole)**were strongly braced against one other by a series of **[robust belly ribs (gastralia)](#398_plesiosaurwhole)**, suggesting that these **[short-tailed](#400_plesiosaurtail)**animals propelled themselves by flapping their **[large, wing-like paddles.](#397_plesiosaurflipper)** Similar to ichthyosaurs, plesiosaur limbs were stiff, broad, and inflexible. Plesiosaur paddles exhibit **[hyperphalangy, but never hyperdactyly.](#57_dolichorhynchopspaddle)**Plesiosauroids had longer forelimbs than hindlimbs and scapulae that touched along the midline, while pliosauroids had longer hindlimbs than forelimbs and separate scapulae.


# 7.5 Mosasauroidea


### (Late Cretaceous)


## Key Features



*   **[Circular quadrate](#402_mosasaurquadrate)**
*   **[Pterygoid teeth](#66_clidastesvarious)**
*   **[Thecodont teeth](#324_prognathodontooth)**
*   **[No mandibular symphysis](#229_tylosaurusprorigerskull)**
*   **[Intramandibular joint](#229_tylosaurusprorigerskull)**
*   **[Procoelous vertebrae](#66_clidastesvarious)** with **[zygosphene and zygantrum](#360_eunectesmurinusvertebra)**

**[Mosasaurs](#403_mosasaurpointcloud)** are the final major group of Mesozoic marine reptiles. These **squamates** first appear in the fossil record in the Late Cretaceous, right when the ichthyosaurs go extinct. Although mosasaurs quickly came to dominate the oceans, they went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous like the dinosaurs. They were heavily modified for aquatic locomotion, with[ large, webbed, oar-like forelimbs, laterally-compressed, likely hypocercal tails,](#404_plesioplatecarpusplanifronswhole) and **[stiffening scales](#405_tylosaurusprorigerscales)** for streamlined locomotion. With their **[procoelous vertebrae,](#66_clidastesvarious)**highly kinetic **[(streptostylic, with mesokinesis and metakinesis)](#229_tylosaurusprorigerskull)** skulls and snakelike **[intramandibular joints,](#177_pythonamethystinusskull)**mosasaurs were indisputably squamates. However, their exact position within Squamata remains uncertain: some analyses place them with **[varanid lizards](#24_varanusskull)** within **Anguimorpha,**while others have them forming a clade with aigialosaurs, dolichosaurs, and snakes **(Pythonomorpha).**

The **[Aigialosauridae](#406_aigialosaurusdalmaticuswhole)** (‘seashore-lizard) were small (~1m), semi-aquatic or coastal squamates that appeared in the Late Cretaceous. They are thought to have been basal mosasaurs, with **laterally-compressed, finless tails** and **unmodified forelimbs.**

The **[Dolichosauridae](#407_pontosauruswhole)** (‘long-lizard’) were another small-bodied group that appeared around the same time, with **reduced, oar-shaped limbs**and **greatly elongated necks and tails.** Various aspects of dolichosaur anatomy align them with the mosasauroids, but their exact interrelationships remain unresolved.


# 7.6 Parareptilia


### (Early Permian - Present? or Triassic?)

The **Parareptilia** (‘beside-lizard’) are a diverse lineage of non-diapsid sauropsids, and are united by a few synapomorphies and several likely plesiomorphies. Generally speaking, parareptiles can be identified by a jaw articulation anterior to the occipitals, and an expanded ilium in the pelvis. These are not strong synapomorphies, so we will not require you to learn them for this course.

The most basal parareptiles include two groups, the **[Millerettidae](#410_millerettaskull)** and the **[Bolosauridae](#61_bolosaurusteeth)**. The milleretids are known from the Upper Permian of South Africa. **_[Eunotosaurus](#411_eunotosauruswhole)_** was considered a member of this group at one point, and its widened, imbricating ribs were cited as a reason for aligning turtles with milleretids. Recent analyses have actually strengthened the relationship between _Eunotosaurus_ and turtles, placing it as a stem turtle separate from the millerettids. The small, herbivorous bolosaurids were another group of parareptiles from the Permian, but their remains are rarely found.


# 7.7 Procolophonia


### (Middle Permian - Late Triassic?)

This clade of parareptiles includes two groups in addition to (possibly) turtles, the **Pareiasauria** and the **Procolophonidae**. The **[pareiasaurs](#409_scutosauruskarpinskiiwhole)** were a group of large (up to 3m) herbivores from the Mid-Late Permian of Africa, Europe, and Asia. They are distinguished by their **[bony cranial protuberances.](#60_elginiaskull)**

**[Procolophonids](#408_sauropareionwhole)** were much smaller herbivores from the Upper Permian and Triassic of Russia, South Africa, and Madagascar.


# 7.8 Pantestudines


### (Upper Permian - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[“T”-shaped ribs](#412_pappochelysreconstruction)**
*   **[Expanded gastralia](#412_pappochelysreconstruction)**
*   **[Synaptosaurid skull](#396_plesiosaurusmacrocephalusskull)** with a single temporal fenestra

**Pantestudines** (“all-tortoises”) was erected to identify those sauropsids closer to turtles than to any other crown group. Precisely _what_ _pantestudines_ _are_ remains subject to some debate, as different analyses have recovered them as members of Parareptilia, Lepidosauromorpha, or Archosauromorpha. What is clear is that there are a few animals that fall along the turtle stem, including **_[Eunotosaurus](#411_eunotosauruswhole)_** and **_[Pappochelys](#413_pappochelysslab),_** the latter of which was described as recently as 2015.

While neither **_Eunotosaurus_** (‘good-back-lizard’) nor **_Pappochelys_** (‘grandfather-turtle’) have the carapace and plastron that would identify them as turtles, they do both have **elaborated, “T”-shaped ribs** and **expanded, paired gastralia** (belly ribs). Their **synaptosaurid skulls**align both of these animals with the Diapsida.

**_[Odontochelys](#414_odontochelyswhole)_** (‘tooth-turtle’) has a **fully-developed plastron,** but is excluded from Testudinata by its **lack of a carapace** and the fact that its **girdles remain outside its ribcage.** Known from 220 million-year-old rocks in China, _Odontochelys_ also **retains teeth,**unlike all members of Testudinata.


# 7.9 Testudinata


### (Late Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Complete carapace](#59_chelydraserpentinacarapace) **formed from **nuchals (cleithra), costals (ribs), and neurals (vertebrae)**
*   **[Complete plastron](#128_spur-thighedtortoiseshell) **formed from **gastralia, epiplastrons (clavicles),** and an **entoplastron (interclavicle)**
*   **[Pectoral and pelvic girdles inside ribcage](#193_matamataturtlewhole)**
*   **[No teeth](#419_archelonischyrosskull)**

Members of **[Testudinata](#420_allaeochelyscrassesculptamatingpair)** are recognizably, indisputably “turtles.” **_[Proganochelys](#416_proganochelysquenstedtiwhole)_** (‘brighter-turtle’), known from the Upper Triassic of Germany and Thailand, is the most important basal turtle. This rugged-looking animal has a **full carapace formed from expanded ribs and vertebrae,** fused to novel dermal bones. The presence of both a plastron and a carapace in _Proganochelys_, as opposed to only a plastron in the earlier _Odontochelys_, suggests that the plastron evolved from modified gastralia prior to the carapace. Like all other turtles, Proganochelys was **[toothless](#415_proganochelysskull).**

Crown turtles are grouped under **[Testudines](#64_stylemysnebraskensisshell),** and are divided into two lineages: the **[Cryptodira](#418_chelydraserpentinawhole)** and the **[Pleurodira.](#193_matamataturtlewhole)** These two groups differ mainly in how they bend their necks: cryptodires can retract their neck inside their shell, while pleurodires bend their neck sideways and tuck it along the shell.
