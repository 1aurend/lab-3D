# 5.16 Crocodylia


### (Cretaceous - Present)

**[Crocodylia](#363_crocodyluswhole2)** includes the ancestor of alligators, crocodiles, and gharials, and all of that ancestor’s descendants. There is some debate about interrelationships within this clade. Traditionally, the **Alligatoridae** and **Crocodylidae** have been considered sister groups. However, recent molecular analyses recover **Gavialidae** and Crocodylidae as sister groups.

**[Gavialidae](#213_gavialisgangeticusskull)** includes the Indian gharial (_Gavialis_) alongside many extinct forms. This lineage is characterized by extremely slender and elongate snouts. Gavialids may be distinguished from other slender-snouted forms by their very small nasal bones. Slender snouts reflect an emphasis on speed of jaw motion rather than force production, and favor the muscles that attach to the supratemporal fenestra over the pterygoideus.

**[Alligatoridae](#364_alligatorandcrocodylusskulls)** includes those crocodylians more closely related to _Alligator_ than to _Crocodylus_. They tend to have broad snouts and, unlike crocodylids, possess a pit in their maxilla into which the 4th dentary tooth fits. Although alligatorids were once found in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, extant alligators are restricted to North America and Southeast Asia, while caimans are found only in South America.

The **[Crocodylidae](#364_alligatorandcrocodylusskulls)** are the ‘true’ crocodiles. Their 4th dentary tooth is visible through a lateral maxillary notch, even with the jaw closed. Crocodylids are found in freshwater and marine environments in and around Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Caribbean.
