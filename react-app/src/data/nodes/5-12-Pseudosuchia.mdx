# 5.12 Pseudosuchia


### (Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[‘Crocodile-normal’ ankle joint:](#90_typothoraxcoccinarumankle)** astragalus and calcaneum form peg and socket
*   **[Double row of paramedian osteoderms](#2_protosuchuswhole)**

Modern crocodylians are often considered ‘living fossils’ with highly conservative biology and anatomy, but much greater diversity is evident once you consider the total group, **Pseudosuchia**(“false-crocodile”). In fact, the earliest pseudosuchians were terrestrial herbivores!

The most basal pseudosuchians include the facultatively-bipedal **[Ornithosuchidae](#352_riojasuchusskull)**(“bird-crocodile”), which retain **[crocodile-reverse ankles](#63_riojasuchusankle)**, the tiny **_[Gracilisuchus](#9_gracilisuchusskull)_** (“slender-crocodile”), and the **[Aetosauria](#351_desmatosuchusspurensiswhole)** (“eagle-llizard”), which are widely distributed across Triassic Europe and the Americas. Members of this last clade are distinguished by their quadrupedal stance, large bodies, small heads, and extensive bony armor. This armor is composed of large plate-like osteoderm scutes, which overlap to cover the entire body.

Further crown-ward we find the **[Poposauroidea](#353_sillosuchuswhole)** and the **[Rauisuchidae](#340_prestosuchuswhole)**. These animals include specialized cursorial predators—in fact, within the shuvoasurid poposauroids we see animals very similar to ornithomimid dinosaurs, while the poposauroids and rauisuchids include large terrestrial predator ecomorphs that precede many of the carnivorous theropods that we will discuss in the next lab.
