[Archeria](s47epiphyses) represents the anthracosaurs ("coal-lizard"), a clade of amphibious tetrapods that existed from the Early Carboniferous to the Early Permian. These animals inhabited lakes and swamps in coal forests, and their skeletons present a mosaic of derived and plesiomorphic features: on the one hand, anthracosaurs possess elongate ribs for costal breathing, robust limbs to support terrestrial locomotion, and the smaller, taller skulls typical of later amniotes; however, the stapes is still used for hearing rather than as a skull support, the palate retains labyrinthodont tusks, and the intercentrum remains large.

The Seymouriamorpha are another group known from the Early Permian. These animals also possess elongate ribs suggestive of costal breathing. Species in this group comprise two morphs that both went through metamorphosis. Forms like Seymouria, which you would have seen in the physical lab but unfortunately we didn't have time to scan, were primarily terrestrial. The vertebral columns of seymouriamorphs featured expanded neural arches that provided a large attachment area for large epaxial muscles.

The Diadectimorpha are exemplified by [Diadectes.](s13alligatorfemur) This group is more derived than lepospondyls, and lived from the Late Carboniferous to the arly Permian. Diadectes was clearly fully terrestrial, with its massive axial and appendicular skeleton and its lack of a lateral line system. The skull of Diadectes lacks either an otic notch or palatal tusks, but possesses unusual premaxillary teeth and an incipient pterygoid flange that suggests a shift towards static pressure feeding.
