# 6.2 Dinosauria


### (Middle Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   Ascending process on astragalus
*   Distinct femoral head offset 90° from shaft
*   Elongated deltopectoral crest

Extant avian dinosaurs are famously diverse (second only to osteichthyans among vertebrates), but extinct **Dinosauria** were much more anatomically disparate. Dinosauria unites two lineages, the **Ornithischia** and the **Saurischia.** Stem dinosaurs are identified by the nested nodes **Dinosauromorpha** and **Dinosauriformes.** These are valid groupings, but there is so little fossil material that we will not discuss them at length here. These Triassic animals, including **_Ixalerpeton_** and **_Marasuchus_** (which may be synonymous with _Marasuchus_), were smaller, long-limbed avemetatarsalians that may have had bipedal or facultatively-bipedal gaits.

Three postcranial characters are diagnostic of dinosaurs: an **ascending process on the astragalus** that overlaps with the anterior surface of the tibia, an **elongated deltopectoral crest**on the humerus **f** or the attachment of the deltoideus and pectoralis muscles, and a **distinct femoral head offset 90° from the diaphysis of the femur.** This latter feature relates to the mammal-like erect limb posture used by dinosaurs, as opposed to the sprawling limb posture used by most other tetrapods—in fact, dinosaur femora and mammalian femora are surprisingly similar in appearance.
