# 7.9 Testudinata


### (Late Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Complete carapace](#59_chelydraserpentinacarapace) **formed from **nuchals (cleithra), costals (ribs), and neurals (vertebrae)**
*   **[Complete plastron](#128_testudograeca) **formed from **gastralia, epiplastrons (clavicles),** and an **entoplastron (interclavicle)**
*   **[Pectoral and pelvic girdles inside ribcage](#193_matamata)**
*   **[No teeth](#419_archelonischyrosskull)**

Members of **[Testudinata](#420_allaeochelyscrassesculptamatingpair)** are recognizably, indisputably “turtles.” **_[Proganochelys](#416_proganochelysquenstedtiwhole)_** (‘brighter-turtle’), known from the Upper Triassic of Germany and Thailand, is the most important basal turtle. This rugged-looking animal has a **full carapace formed from expanded ribs and vertebrae,** fused to novel dermal bones. The presence of both a plastron and a carapace in _Proganochelys_, as opposed to only a plastron in the earlier _Odontochelys_, suggests that the plastron evolved from modified gastralia prior to the carapace. Like all other turtles, Proganochelys was **[toothless](#415_proganochelysskull).**

Crown turtles are grouped under **[Testudines](#64_stylemysnebraskensisshell),** and are divided into two lineages: the **[Cryptodira](#418_chelydraserpentinawhole)** and the **[Pleurodira.](#193_matamata)** These two groups differ mainly in how they bend their necks: cryptodires can retract their neck inside their shell, while pleurodires bend their neck sideways and tuck it along the shell.
