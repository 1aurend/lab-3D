**Amniota** is defined as the clade including the ancestor of living mammals, ‘reptiles,’ and birds,  as well as all of that ancestor’s descendants. This unites two lineages: the **Synapsida** and the **Sauropsida**. We will return to synapsids towards the end of the course, beginning with Lab 8. The tiny Early Carboniferous **_[Casineria](#311_casineriakiddislab)_**  is known only from as a post-cranial skeleton with strongly ossified, gracile limbs, and is often considered to be the earliest known amniote.

Amniotes are characterized by a number of important features, all relating in one way or another to a terrestrial lifestyle. Perhaps the most important innovation was the **amniotic egg.** While even the most terrestrialized non-amniote tetrapods must return to the water to lay their eggs lest they dry out, the complex, shelled amniotic egg provides multiple layers of protection to the developing embryo, and allows amniotes to finally reproduce away from the water. The shell provides both mechanical and mineral support; the chorion furnishes a protective cushion; the amnion prevents desiccation; the allantois promotes gas exchange and waste excretion; and finally the yolk sac fuels prolonged development. Early amniote eggs are very rare in the fossil record, but here at the MCZ we happen to have the **[oldest known amniotic egg](#4_amniotaegg)** ever found.

Remember how the **reduction of the dermal girdle**to create a neck was a key step in the evolution of tetrapods? Amniotes continue the trend of shrinking various elements of the dermal pectoral girdle: the cleithrum, clavicle, and interclavicle are independently reduced (and sometimes lost) within the sauropsid and synapsid lines.

Unlike non-amniote tetrapods, which use buccal pumping to ventilate their lungs (and therefore need large, flat skulls to move more air), amniotes shift the task of breathing to their ribs (costal ventilation), and have relatively tall, small skulls. This change in skull shape has the effect of reorienting the jaw-closing adductor mandibulae muscle to be more vertical. Together with the presence of the new pterygoideus muscle (reflected in the development of a **pterygoid flange** for it to attach to), this permitted a transition away from plesiomorphic inertial snapping feeding (enclosing food with the jaws in a single snapping motion) and towards derived static pressure feeding (biting down on food and applying pressure with marginal teeth). The ear has also been reconfigured: the **stapes now serves as a brace[](#204_varanussalvatorskull)supportingthe skull,** and the **otic notch is now lost.**

We end up talking about ankle morphology a lot, for a couple of reasons: dense, compact tarsal bones tend to preserve well, and they contain useful information about the locomotor habits of the animals they come from. The formation of an **astragalus** from the fusion of multiple ankle bones provided increased stiffness and stability to the foot (=pes) for getting around better on land.
