## Key Features



*   **[“T”-shaped ribs](#412_pappochelysreconstruction)**
*   **[Expanded gastralia](#412_pappochelysreconstruction)**
*   **[Synaptosaurid skull](#396_plesiosaurusmacrocephalusskull)** with a single temporal fenestra

**Pantestudines** (“all-tortoises”) was erected to identify those sauropsids closer to turtles than to any other crown group. Precisely _what_ _pantestudines_ _are_ remains subject to some debate, as different analyses have recovered them as members of Parareptilia, Lepidosauromorpha, or Archosauromorpha. What is clear is that there are a few animals that fall along the turtle stem, including **_[Eunotosaurus](#411_eunotosauruswhole)_** and **_[Pappochelys](#413_pappochelysslab),_** the latter of which was described as recently as 2015.

While neither **_Eunotosaurus_** (‘good-back-lizard’) nor **_Pappochelys_** (‘grandfather-turtle’) have the carapace and plastron that would identify them as turtles, they do both have **elaborated, “T”-shaped ribs** and **expanded, paired gastralia** (belly ribs). Their **synaptosaurid skulls** align both of these animals with the Diapsida.

**_[Odontochelys](#414_odontochelyswhole)_** (‘tooth-turtle’) has a **fully-developed plastron,** but is excluded from Testudinata by its **lack of a carapace** and the fact that its **girdles remain outside its ribcage.** Known from 220 million-year-old rocks in China, _Odontochelys_ also **retains teeth,**unlike all members of Testudinata.
