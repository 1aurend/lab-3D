**Therapsida** (“beast-arch”) includes those synapsids more closely related to extant mammals than the sphenacodontidae. One of the most basal therapsid lineages is the **[Biarmosuchia](#441_biarmosuchustenerwhole)**(“Bjarmaland-crocodile”), from the Middle and Late Permian of Russia, South Africa, and China. Most biarmosuchians are thought to have been small carnivores. They are generally similar to sphenacodontids, but possess a reduced pectoral girdle, longer, more gracile limbs, and more open temporal fenestrae.

More-derived therapsids include the **Dinocephalia,** the **Anomodontia,** and the **Theriodonta**. **Dinocephalians**(“terrible-head”) are known only from the Middle Permian of Russia and South Africa, and can be recognized from their **interlocking dentition.** This group diversified very rapidly, with over 40 genera currently recognized, and filled both large predator and herbivore niches. Even though these species were major components of Middle Permian ecosystems, they all went extinct and were replaced by more derived gorgonopsians and dicynodonts in the Late Periman. The **[anteosaurids](#443_titanophoneuswhole)** and the **[titanosuchids](#442_jonkeriaskull)**were large carnivores, with short limbs, heavily-built skulls, and well-developed incisors and canines. The herbivorous **[tapinocephalids](#444_moschopscapensiswhole)** were a sight to behold, weighing up to two tons, with **deep bodies, shoulders higher than their hips,**  and **thick, domed, downward-pointing skulls.**

**Anomodontia** (“unusual-tooth”) is a cosmopolitan clade from the Late Permian to Late Triassic, which includes the diverse **Dicynodontia** and close relatives. All anomodonts appear to have been facultative or obligate herbivores. **_[Suminia](#448_suminiaskull),_** a basal anomodont from the Late Permian, has a short snout and differentiated teeth for herbivory, but also long limbs with grasping hands and feet. It has been posited to be the oldest known arboreal (tree-living) tetrapod.

**[Dicynodonts](#69_dinodontosaurusverts)** (“two-dog-tooth”) were an incredibly successful clade, potentially the most diverse group of non-mammalian synapsids with over 60 genera currently recognized. The members of this clade were the dominant herbivores in Late Permian ecosystems, and are commonly found at fossil localities. Dicynodonts are clearly recognizable by their **[short, stocky bodies, powerful forelimbs,](#422_ischigualastiawhole)[absent anterior teeth, prominent canine tusks, large adductor chambers,](#70_dinodontosaurusskull)**and **keratinous beaks**. The presence of a large retroarticular process on the mandible and a specialized “roller-like” articular surface suggest that the jaws allowed **propalinal movement**for processing vegetation, rather than just opening and closing. Although most species were terrestrial herbivores, some became specialized for fossorial lifestyles, excavating burrows and digging for buried food. Ranging in mass from rat-sized to hippo-sized, dicynodonts were one of the few groups to survive the Permo-Triassic mass extinction, but their numbers still dipped significantly. They were once again widespread by the Mid-Triassic, but would eventually go extinct at the end of the Triassic.
