# 6.12 Maniraptora


### (Late Jurassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Very long arms](#283_ajancingeniawhole)**
*   **[Ossified sternum](#282_citipatiosmolskaewhole)**

This node is where saurischian dinosaurs begin to look very much like birds. Limbs get longer, and the **pubis begins to angle backwards** to point ventrally or even caudoventrally. The best-known members of the **Maniraptora** (“hand-plunderer”) are the derived dromaeosaurian “raptors”, which tend to feature heavily in pop-culture depictions of dinosaurs. The **Dromaeosauridae** and their sister group the **Troodontidae** are grouped under a separate node closer to birds, the **Paraves,** but the rest of the maniraptorans are just as fascinating. **[Therizinosauroidea](#253_erlikosaurusskull)** are a clade of bizarre, massive maniraptorans that were originally thought to be predatory based on their **[enormous clawed forelimbs.](#281_therizinosaurusarms)** They are now thought to have been omnivorous or herbivorous. The **Oviraptorosauria** were feathered maniraptorans with boxy, beaked, sometimes crested skulls and short, birdlike tails. They were originally thought to be egg-eaters based on a **[famous fossil of an oviraptorosaur in association with a nest,](#284_citipatiosmolskaenest)** but the eggs were later discovered to be the dinosaur’s own. Oviraptors have a fused semi-lunate carpal in their wrists, which allowed their hands to adopt a flexed, wing-like posture. The diminutive, small-handed **[Alvarezsauridae](#285_patagonykuswhole)** are sometimes grouped with the maniraptorans, but relationships in this region of the tree tend to shift around with each new analysis.
