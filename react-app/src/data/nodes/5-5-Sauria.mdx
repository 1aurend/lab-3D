## Key Features



*   **[Slender, S-shaped femur](#22_homoeosaurusmaximilianiwhole)**

**Sauria** unites the lineage leading to extant lizards and snakes, the **Lepidosauromorpha,** with the lineage leading to extant crocodylians and birds, the **Archosauromorpha.** Sauria is a crown group that, depending on the phylogenetic position of turtles, may or may not be synonymous with crown ‘reptiles’ (we will return to this point later).
