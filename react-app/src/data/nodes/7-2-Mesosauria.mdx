# 7.2 Mesosauria


### (Early Permian - Late Permian)

The **[Mesosauria](#381_mesosauruswhole)** (‘middle-lizard’) were relatively small, aquatic animals with **large, webbed hind feet** and **long, laterally-compressed tails** for swimming. Further evidence of their aquatic lifestyle can be seen in their dense, **[pachyostotic ribs,](#62_mesosauruswhole)** which would have aided in buoyancy control. Pachyostosis (‘thick-bone’) is a common feature in many of the other aquatic groups in this lab. The first amniotes did not start venturing out onto land until the Carboniferous, making the Early Permian mesosaurs the first secondarily-aquatic amniotes. Despite their single infratemporal fenestra, mesosaurs were either basal sauropsids or basal parareptiles, rather than members of Diapsida or Synapsida.
