# 5.14 Mesoeucrocodylia


### (Early Jurassic - Present)

Key Features



*   **[Partial secondary palate](#365_mariliasuchusamaraliskull) with choanae in palatines**

This node includes those crocodylomorphs more closely related to extant crocodylians than _Protosuchus_. **Mesoeucrocodylians** (“middle-good-crocodile”) are very diverse, with open-ocean representatives as well as fascinating terrestrial animals that ‘scoop’ a number of mammalian ecomorphs.

**[Thalattosuchians](#357_steneosaurusslab)** (‘sea-crocodile’) are bizarre, **[longirostrine](#356_pelagosaurusskull)** oceangoing predators that take aquatic adaptations to the extreme. Members of this clade **[reduce their dermal armor](#358_steneosaurusosteoderms)** and lighten their endoskeletons for better buoyancy control, and propel themselves through the water with secondarily-derived hypocercal tails. **[Pholidosaurids](#19_crocodilaemusrobustuswhole)**(“scale-lizard”) are a related group of mesoeucrocodylians that retain a more conventionally crocodile-like morphology, but attained enormous body sizes.

**[Notosuchians](#355_notosuchuscranium)** (“back-crocodile”), on the other hand, are a terrestrial clade that occupy dietary niches ranging from obligate herbivory to hypercarnivory. Notosuchians are generally small-bodied, with skull shapes that diverge wildly from the standard ‘crocodile’ pattern, and more closely resemble modern-day birds and mammals.
