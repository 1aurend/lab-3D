The birds, the bats, and the **Pterosauria** (‘wing-lizard’) are the three groups of vertebrates to have evolved powered flight. Triassic Pterosaurs most likely beat everyone else into the air, since the **[first avialan theropods](#372_archaeopteryxlithographicalagerstatten)** arrive in the Late Jurassic and **[bats do not appear until the Cenozoic.](#371_icaronycterisbat)**  The pterosaurs are the sister group to the Dinosauromorpha, meaning that the avemetatarsalian archosaurs evolved flight twice!

Unlike bats, which evolve a wing membrane **(patagium)**stretched between all five manual digits, and birds, in which the wing skeleton supports a large lifting area made up of feathers, the **[pterosaur wing](#373_batbirdpterodactylwing)** is composed of a posterior **brachiopatagium** stretched between the body and the **elongated fourth finger,** and an anterior **propatagium** supported by a mobile **pteroid** (modified carpal) bone. A smaller **uropatagium** spans the gap between each foot and the tail. Since even the most basal pterosaurs (like the Late Triassic **_[Eudimorphodon](#374_eudimorphodonwhole)_**) already have all the anatomical features associated with flight, the sequence of changes leading to volancy in this lineage are unclear.

Pterosaurs are thought to have evolved from a bipedal ancestor, but evidence from trackways shows that most of them walked quadrupedally, using their feet and their first three manual digits. Like derived theropods, pterosaurs have **hollow bones** to reduce weight. Their bodies are often comically small relative to their heads, with axial modifications like a fused **synsacrum** (convergent on the bird condition) and several dorsal vertebrae fused into a **notarium.** Their patagia were supported by stiff **actinofibrils,** and some forms had dense **[pycnofibers](#375_sordespilosuspycnofibers)** covering the body, likely for thermoregulation at high altitudes .

There are two major groups of pterosaurs, the likely paraphyletic **[“Rhamphorhynchoidea”](#376_raeticodactylusanimation)** (“beak-snout”) and the monophyletic **[Pterodactyloidea](#369_phosphatodracowhole)** (“wing-finger”). Basal pterosaurs like **_[Rhamphorhynchus](#370_rhamphorhynchusmuensteriactinofibrils)_** retain many plesiomorphic characters, like long, vaned tailes, an elongated pedal digit V supporting the uropatagium, short necks, and toothy jaws, and were found primarily in the Jurassic. The Pterodactyloidea (named after **_[Pterodactylus,](#16_pterodactyluslongirostriswhole)_** which, incidentally, was described in 1784 as an **[aquatic animal](#377_pterodactylusaquatic)**) appear in the Late Jurassic and can be distinguished from other pterosaurs by their longer necks, reduced tails, and larger body size. Some pterodactyloids lose their teeth (e.g., **_[Pteranodon](#378_pteranodonskull)_**) while others modify their teeth into sieves for straining prey from water (e.g., **_[Ctenochasma](#379_ctenochasmaskull)_**). Many evolve **[elaborate cranial crests,](#380_tupandactyluscrest)** the function of which is still unclear.
