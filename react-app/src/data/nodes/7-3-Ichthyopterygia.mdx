# 7.3 Ichthyopterygia


### (Early Triassic - Late Cretaceous)


## Key Features



*   **[Very large orbit with sclerotic ring](#385_ichthyosaurskull)**
*   **[Amphicoelous,](#384_ichthyosauramphicoelous)** disc-shaped **[“ashtray” vertebrae,](#387_ichthyosaurusconybeariwhole)** lacking transverse processes and zygapophyses
*   **[Dorsal fin](#388_ichthyosaurdorsalfin)** and **[lunate, hypocercal caudal fin](#387_ichthyosaurusconybeariwhole)** for axial swimming
*   **Paddle-like limbs** with **[hyperphalangy](#382_ichthyosaurpaddle)** and **[hyperdactyly](#386_ichthyosaurusanningaeslab)**

The **[Ichthyopterygia](#386_ichthyosaurusanningaeslab)** (‘fish-wing’) are a group of marine reptiles found throughout most of the Mesozoic, with a body shape convergent on modern dolphins. Their derived anatomy has made it difficult to determine their phylogenetic position—they were definitely diapsids, but it is unclear whether they were a stem lineage or if they belonged to either Lepidosauromorpha or Archosauromorpha.

Ichthyopterygians were entirely adapted to life in the water, giving birth to live young **[(viviparity)](#389_chaohusaurusviviparity)**and using their limbs to steer while propelling themselves with their vertebral columns and tails. Basal forms were very recognizable as ‘reptiles’, but derived members of the lineage evolved progressively more fusiform (streamlined, tapering) bodies and **hypocercal caudal fins,** as revealed by **[fossilized body impressions.](#388_ichthyosaurdorsalfin)**Their **reduced pelvic limbs** often lack any connection to the vertebral column. The large, stiff, **paddle- shaped forelimbs** are composed of multiple **disc-shaped elements,** and lack any mobile joints distal to the glenoid fossa. Some lineages exhibit **hyperdactyly** (extra digits), and all but the most basal animals show **hyperphalagy** (extra phalanges per digit). Ichthyopterygian skulls are very distinctive, with **toothy, elongated rostrums** and **enlarged orbits.** Many derived forms have truly enormous orbits, which, together with the sclerotic rings with which they are often found, may be indicative of an ability to dive to incredible depths.
