# 5.8 Squamata


### (Lower Jurassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **Cranial kinesis via [streptostyly](#332_lialisburtoniswhole)** (some have **[mesokinetic](#328_uroplatusfimbriatusskull)** and **[metakinetic](#332_lialisburtoniswhole)** joints)
*   **[Procoelous vertebrae](#338_varanussalvatorpelvis)** with accessory **[zygosphene-zygantrum articulation](#360_eunectesmurinusvertebra)**.
*   **Chemoreception** via **bifurcated tongue** and **[elaborated vomeronasal organ](#339_corallusendocast)**

**Squamata **(“scaled”), which unites lizards with snakes, is fantastically diverse. Various squamate groups have independently evolved limblessness, including the limbless **[pygopodid geckos](#332_lialisburtoniswhole)**, the **[burrowing](#206_amphisbaenafuliginosaskull)** **[amphisbaenids](#141_macrorhineuraskinneriskull)**, the grass lizards of **_[Chamaesaura](#329_chamaesauraanguinawhole),_** various **[skinks](#335_feyliniacurroriwhole)**, and of course the snakes of **[Serpentes](#330_bitiscaudaliswhole)** (total group Ophidia).

**Skull kinesis** is an important synapomorphy of squamates. The ancestral squamate lacked a lower temporal bar, allowing the quadrate to move more freely. This is called **["streptostyly"](#332_lialisburtoniswhole)** and allows squamates to open their jaws more fully. The oldest known squamate, **_[Megachirella](#346_megachirellawachtlerislab)_** from the Middle Triassic of Italy, features a reduced lower temporal bar, presaging the development of greater cranial mobility in later squamates. Some squamates, like geckos, possess a joint between the frontal and the parietal. This **[mesokinetic](#328_uroplatusfimbriatusskull)** joint enables the front of the face to flex up and down. This is particularly useful for keeping prey in the mouth as the animal bites down. Some groups, like pygopodids, go even further and evolve a **[metakinetic](#332_lialisburtoniswhole)** joint between the braincase and the skull roof. **[Snakes](#334_corallusskull)**, of course, take cranial kinesis to a whole other level, from the **[hinged, expanding skulls and separated mandibles](#212_heterodonplatirhinoseatingfrog)** of the **[macrostomatans](#211_crotalusadamanteusskull)** to the **[maxillary](#210_typhlopslumbricalismaxillaryrake)** and **[mandibular rakes](#215_leptotyphlopsscutifronsmandibularrake)** of the scolecophidian blind snakes.
