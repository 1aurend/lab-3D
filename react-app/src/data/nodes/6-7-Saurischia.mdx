# 6.7 Saurischia


### (Late Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Subnarial foramen ](#259_herrerasaurusskull)**
*   **[Accessory articulations in the dorsal vertebrae (hyposphene & hypantrum) ](#257_sauropodvert)**
*   Elongated necks with **[pneumatized cervical vertebrae](#269_diplodocusvert)**

**Saurischia** are the other, and only extant, lineage of dinosaurs. These “lizard-hipped” dinosaurs are so named because they retain the ancestral condition of a cranially-oriented pubis, although this changes as we get closer to birds. Saurischia is itself divided into the sauropod lineage **Sauropodomorpha** and the bird lineage **Theropoda.** The **Herrerasauridae,**such as **_[Staurikosaurus,](#258_staurikosauruswhole)_**are either basal saurischians or basal theropods, and exhibit many of the synapomorphies for Saurischia.

Saurischians can be recognized by the presence of a small **subnarial foramen** ventral to the naris/external nostril, **additional articulations called the hyposphene and the hypantrum**that form tongue-and-groove connections between the dorsal vertebrae and may have had a stiffening function, as well as **elongated necks with pneumatized cervical vertebrae** to accommodate air sacs for gas exchange.
