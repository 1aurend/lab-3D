# 7.4 Sauropterygia


### (Late Triassic - Late Cretaceous)


## Key Features



*   Large premaxilla forms **[snout anterior to external nares](#58_dolichorhynchopsskull)**
*   **[Synaptosaurid skull](#396_plesiosaurusmacrocephalusskull)** with a complete supratemporal fenestra and an incomplete infratemporal fenestra

The **Sauropterygia** (‘lizard-wing’) are another Mesozoic clade of marine diapsids (possibly lepidosauro- morphs or archosauromorphs). The first and most basal group are the Mid to Late Triassic **[Placodontia](#390_placodusgigaswhole)** (‘tablet-tooth’). These animals are named for the **[plate-like crushing dentition](#391_cyamodusdentition)** on their jaw margin and palate, which they likely used to eat hard-shelled invertebrates. Placodonts swam through shallow coastal waters with their **paddle-shaped limbs, laterally-compressed tails,** and **pachyostotic ribs.** Some placodonts actually had a shell that superficially resembled a turtle carapace, but was **[made entirely out of osteoderms.](#392_psephodermaosteoderms)**

The other two sauropterygian groups form a clade. The **Nothosauria** lived in shallow coastal waters during the Middle Triassic and can be recognized by their **elongated necks, protruding recumbent teeth, pachyostotic ribs,** and **webbed, oar-like limbs.** Nothosaurians ranged from 20cm to 4m in length and included the true **[nothosaurs](#394_nothosauruswhole)** and the smaller, basal **[pachypleurosaurs](#56_pachypleurosauruswhole).**

The **Plesiosauria** are the best-known group of sauropterygians, and include two main lineages: the **[Pliosauroidea](#395_liopleurodonferoxwhole)** (’more-lizard’) and the **[Plesiosauroidea](#398_plesiosaurwhole)** (’near-lizard’). The plesiosauroids had **small skulls and long necks** (think ‘Loch Ness Monster’) while the pliosauroids had **large skulls and short necks.** Plesiosaurs originated at the Triassic/Jurassic boundary, and were dominant in oceans worldwide until the Late Cretaceous. Like ichthyosaurs, they were **[viviparous](#399_polycotyluswithfetus)**. Plesiosauroids are thought to have used their long necks and **[peg-like teeth](#396_plesiosaurusmacrocephalusskull)** to ambush smaller fish or squid, while the pliosauroids were likely fast-moving pursuit predators that dove to great depths to take large-bodied prey with their **[giant, conical teeth.](#401_pliosauruscarpenteriskull)**

The plesiosaurs were heavily modified for aquatic locomotion. Their **expanded, ventrally-positioned girdles** were strongly braced against one other by a series of **robust belly ribs (gastralia)**, suggesting that these **[short-tailed](#400_plesiosaurtail)** animals propelled themselves by flapping their **[large, wing-like paddles.](#397_plesiosaurflipper)** Similar to ichthyosaurs, plesiosaur limbs were stiff, broad, and inflexible. Plesiosaur paddles exhibit **[hyperphalangy, but never hyperdactyly.](#57_dolichorhynchopspaddle)** Plesiosauroids had longer forelimbs than hindlimbs and scapulae that touched along the midline, while pliosauroids had longer hindlimbs than forelimbs and separate scapulae.
