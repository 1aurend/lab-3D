The armored **Thyreophora** (“shield-bearer”) are one of three major groups of ornithischian dinosaurs, and include the iconic stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. The derived members of this group are recognizable by their heavy dermal ornamentation and armor, but more basal Jurassic thyreophorans, such as _Scutellosaurus_ and _Scelidosaurus,_ exhibit a moasaic of tiny **osteoderms** covering the body. The small, bipedal **_[Scutellosaurus](#232_scutellosaurusreconstruction)_** resembles a basal ornithischian, but with scutes. By comparison, **_[Scelidosaurus](#233_scelidosauruswhole)_** is larger and quadrupedal, like more derived thyreophorans.

The **[Stegosauria](#234_stegosauruswhole)** (“roof-lizard”) are one of the two major derived thyreophoran clades. These small-headed, quadrupedal animals had relatively long hindlimbs, making them much taller and bulkier at the hip than at the shoulder. They are recognizable by the **osteoderm-derived plates and spines** all over their bodies (parascapular spines, parasagittal plate/spike rows, caudal thagomizer), the tall neural spines on their dorsal vertebrae, and their **[reduced or absent antorbital fenestrae.](#224_stegosaurusarmatusskull)**

The other major thyreophoran clade are the **[Ankylosauria](#225_euoplocephalusskull)** (“bent/crooked-lizard”), which had a cosmopoli- tan distribution (worldwide except for Africa) from the Middle Jurassic to the Cretaceous. Ankylosaurs feature extensive **[osteoderms](#237_borealopeltascutes)** elaborated into a bony dorsal armor covering. They are even more strangely proportioned than stegosaurs, with extremely wide bodies that overhang the limb girdles. Some of their dorsal, sacral, and caudal vertebrae were fused into a synsacrum, and unusually for dinosaurs, their ac- etabular fenestrae were secondarily closed. Their skulls were often ornamented and lacked fenestrae, but contained **[convoluted nasal passages](#235_kunbarrasaurusieversinasalpassages)** that may have aided in cooling the brain. Many ankylosaurs had tail clubs, but we also know of several that lacked this specialization, including **_[Edmontonia.](#236_edmontoniawhole)_**
