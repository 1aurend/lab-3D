## Key Features



*   **[Secondary palate extends to posterior cheek teeth](#313_probelesodonsanjuanensisskull)**
*   **[Pineal foramen lost](#318_probainognathusskull)**
*   **[Differentiated superficial masseter muscle](#313_probelesodonsanjuanensisskull)**
*   **[Secondary jaw joint](#318_probainognathusskull)**

The **Probainognathia** (“progressive-jaw”) are those animals more closely related to Mammalia than to Cynognathia. There are five clades of probainognathians, four of which form progessive outgroups to the Mammaliaformes: the **Chiniquodontidae, Probainognathidae, Tritheledontidae,** and **Tritylodontidae.** Beginning with the probainognathians, cynodonts along the mammalian lineage feature a derived, **secondary dentary-squamosal jaw articulation** in addition to the plesiomorphic **quadrate-articular articulation.** The quadrate and articular will eventually lose their role in the jaw joint entirely and migrate to the middle ear, where they are known as the incus and malleus respectively. There is also some evidence that the very **first whiskers**  may have evolved at this node.
