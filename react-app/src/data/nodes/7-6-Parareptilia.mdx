# 7.6 Parareptilia


### (Early Permian - Present? or Triassic?)

The **Parareptilia** (‘beside-lizard’) are a diverse lineage of non-diapsid sauropsids, and are united by a few synapomorphies and several likely plesiomorphies. Generally speaking, parareptiles can be identified by a jaw articulation anterior to the occipitals, and an expanded ilium in the pelvis. These are not strong synapomorphies, so we will not require you to learn them for this course.

The most basal parareptiles include two groups, the **[Millerettidae](#410_millerettaskull)** and the **[Bolosauridae](#61_bolosaurusteeth)**. The milleretids are known from the Upper Permian of South Africa. **_[Eunotosaurus](#411_eunotosauruswhole)_** was considered a member of this group at one point, and its widened, imbricating ribs were cited as a reason for aligning turtles with milleretids. Recent analyses have actually strengthened the relationship between _Eunotosaurus_ and turtles, placing it as a stem turtle separate from the millerettids. The small, herbivorous bolosaurids were another group of parareptiles from the Permian, but their remains are rarely found.
