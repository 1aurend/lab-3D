# 5.4 Diapsida


### (Carboniferous - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Supratemporal and infratemporal fenestrae](#202_sphenodonskull)**
*   **[Elongate cervical region](#26_araeosceliswhole)**

Amniotes are classically divided into **anapsids,**(“without-arch”) **synapsids,**(“together-arch”) **** and **diapsids** (“two-arch”) based on the number and location of temporal fenestrae on their skulls. These openings are thought to accommodate more extensive attachments for larger jaw muscles, while also permitting these muscles to bulge outwards for greater force production.

**Diapsida** unites all sauropsids that possess **both** **supratemporal** **and infratemporal fenestrae.** This group traditionally includes all living sauropsids except turtles. The lower (infratemporal) fenestra is bounded dorsally by the postorbital and squamosal and ventrally by the jugal and quadratojugal. This opening is in the same position as the **[single, convergently-derived fenestra](#312_inostranceviaalexandriskull)**  in synapsids. The upper (supratemporal) fenestra is between the postorbital and squamosal on the lateral edge and the parietal medially. There is a great deal of variation and evolution in skull morphology, so don’t be surprised when fenestrae move around or disappear.

The first diapsids were the small, superficially lizard-like **Araeoscelidia,** which are known from the Late Carboniferous to the Early Permian. These animals were small and superficially resembled lizards. The specimen of **_[Araeoscelis](#26_araeosceliswhole)_** out in lab actually happens to be the holotype, and shows the **elongated early diapsid neck** clearly.

Diapsida also includes several major groups of mesozoic marine reptiles, including plesiosaurs (Sauropterygia) and ichthyosaurs (Ichthyopterygia). We will discuss these groups, along with other marine reptiles, in Lab 7.

More derived diapsids are grouped together under **Neodiapsida.** This is a somewhat unnecessary node lacking clear synapomorphies, so we do not require you to know it. In addition to members of Sauria proper, this also likely includes the arboreal, gliding members of the **[Coelurosauravidae](#319_coelurosauravuswhole)** (formerly Weigeltisauridae) from the Permian, and the small ‘lizard-like’[ ‘Younginiformes’](#320_younginawhole) from the Late Permian and Early Triassic. The possibly-paraphyletic Younginiformes encompass both aquatic and terrestrial forms, and are mostly known from post-crania.
