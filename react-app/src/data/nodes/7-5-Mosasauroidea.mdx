**[Mosasaurs](#403_mosasaurpointcloud)** are the final major group of Mesozoic marine reptiles. These **squamates** first appear in the fossil record in the Late Cretaceous, right when the ichthyosaurs go extinct. Although mosasaurs quickly came to dominate the oceans, they went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous like the dinosaurs. They were heavily modified for aquatic locomotion, with[ large, webbed, oar-like forelimbs, laterally-compressed, likely hypocercal tails,](#404_plesioplatecarpusplanifronswhole) and **[stiffening scales](#405_tylosaurusprorigerscales)** for streamlined locomotion. With their **procoelous vertebrae,**highly kinetic **(streptostylic, with mesokinesis and metakinesis)** skulls and snakelike **[intramandibular joints,](#177_pythonamethystinusskull)**mosasaurs were indisputably squamates. However, their exact position within Squamata remains uncertain: some analyses place them with **[varanid lizards](#24_varanusskull)** within **Anguimorpha,**while others have them forming a clade with aigialosaurs, dolichosaurs, and snakes **(Pythonomorpha).**

The **[Aigialosauridae](#406_aigialosaurusdalmaticuswhole)** (‘seashore-lizard) were small (~1m), semi-aquatic or coastal squamates that appeared in the Late Cretaceous. They are thought to have been basal mosasaurs, with **laterally-compressed, finless tails** and **unmodified forelimbs.**

The **[Dolichosauridae](#407_pontosauruswhole)** (‘long-lizard’) were another small-bodied group that appeared around the same time, with **reduced, oar-shaped limbs**and **greatly elongated necks and tails.** Various aspects of dolichosaur anatomy align them with the mosasauroids, but their exact interrelationships remain unresolved.
