### (Jurassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Large, tridactyl manus (hand), with manual digits IV and V lost](#274_crylophosauruswhole)**
*   **[Stiffened tail with interlocking caudal vertebrae ](#260_seismosaurusandsaurophaganaxwhole)**

*   **[Teeth concentrated towards front of jaw](#255_allosaurusskull)**

**Tetanurae** (“stretch-tail”) includes those theropods more closely related to _Tyrannosaurus_ than to _Coelo-_ physis. This clade’s name references their stiffened tails, but tetanurans and more derived clades also show increased lightening of the cranial and post-cranial skeleton, beginning in Tetanura with the **maxillary fenestra**(rostral to the antorbital fenestra).

Basal tetanurans include two main groups: the **Megalosauroidea** and the **Allosauroidea**. The Megalosauroidea have elongate skulls and strong forelimbs with large manual digit I unguals, and include **_[Megalosaurus,](#275_megalosauruspelviclimb)_** the first non-avian theropod to be named—although as with _Iguanodon_, the **[first reconstructions were laughably inaccurate](#290_megalosaurusreconstruction)**—as well as **_[Spinosaurus](#277_spinosauruswhole)_**, a giant water-dwelling piscivore with a sail composed of elongated neural spines. The Allosauroidea are named after their most famous member, **_[Allosaurus,](#255_allosaurusskull)_** but also include the **[cacharodontosaurs,](#276_carcharodontosaurtooth)** so-named for their flattened, shark-like teeth. Allosauroids are the first to exhibit the **[enlarged, boot-shaped pubic peduncle](#38_allosauruspubicboot)**characteristic of derived theropods.
