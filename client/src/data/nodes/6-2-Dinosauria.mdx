*   **[Elongated deltopectoral crest](#217_hypacrosaurus)**

Extant avian dinosaurs are famously diverse (second only to osteichthyans among vertebrates), but extinct **Dinosauria** were much more anatomically disparate. Dinosauria unites two lineages, the **Ornithischia** and the **Saurischia.** Stem dinosaurs are identified by the nested nodes **Dinosauromorpha** and **Dinosauriformes.** These are valid groupings, but there is so little fossil material that we will not discuss them at length here. These Triassic animals, including **_[Ixalerpeton](#218_ixalerpetonmodel)_** and **_[Marasuchus](#219_marasuchusskeleton)_** (which may be synonymous with _Marasuchus_), were smaller, long-limbed avemetatarsalians that may have had bipedal or facultatively-bipedal gaits.

Three postcranial characters are diagnostic of dinosaurs: an **ascending process on the astragalus** that overlaps with the anterior surface of the tibia, an **elongated deltopectoral crest**on the humerus **f** or the attachment of the deltoideus and pectoralis muscles, and a **distinct femoral head offset 90° from the diaphysis of the femur.** This latter feature relates to the derived, erect limb posture used by dinosaurs, as opposed to the sprawling limb posture used by most other tetrapods.

The MCZ’s Vertebrate Paleontology collection has a selection of dinosaur material, including a **[dinosaur egg!](#6_dinosauriaegg)**
