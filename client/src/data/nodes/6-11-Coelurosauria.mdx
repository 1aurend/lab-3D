**Coelurosauria** (“hollow-tail-lizard”) includes those tetanurans more derived than Allosauroidea. This group includes **_[Compsognathus,](#17_compsognathuswhole)_**one of the smallest non-avian theropods, known from the same Jurassic Solnhofen deposits that gave us _Archaeopteryx._ Basal members of this group include the **Tyrannosauroidea** and the **Ornithomimosauria.**The massive, tiny-armed ** _[Tyrannosaurus rex](#216_tyrannosaurusrextrixwhole)_ **  needs no introduction, but many of its close relatives were much smaller. **[Tyrannosaurids](#280_gorgosauruslibratuswhole)** are distinguished by their fused nasals, wide skulls, and incisiform premaxillary teeth, and tend to have elongate legs with **long metatarsals. Ornithomimids,**like **_[Gallimimus,](#279_gallimimuswhole)_**are called “ostrich mimics” due to their tiny skulls, long, slender hindlimbs, and reduced teeth. The bizarre, long-armed Deinocheirus also falls within this group. As well as **enlarged orbits and brains,** Coelurosauria is also where we see the first definitive **simple feathers,** as exemplified by **_[Sinosauropteryx.](#278_sinosauropteryxwhole)_**
