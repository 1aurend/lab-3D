# 5.1 Reptiliomorpha


### (Early Carboniferous - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Pleurocentrum is dominant element of vertebral body](#21_archeriaverts)**
*   **[Elongate ribs](#201_sphenodonwhole)** for costal breathing

**Reptiliomorpha** (“crawling-shape”) are the total-group amniotes, and include four stem groups: the Anthracosauria, the Seymouriamorpha, the Lepospondyli (which we discussed in Lab 4), and the Diadectimorpha in addition to the amniote crown.

First to diverge are the **[Anthracosauria](#305_seymouriabaylorensiswhole)** (“coal-lizards”), a group of amphibious tetrapods known from lakes and swamps of coal forests. Anthracosaurs were very diverse, and ranged in length from 50cm to over 3m. Anthracosaurs present a mosaic of amniote and non-amniote features: on the one hand, their **elongate ribs**(for costal ventilation), robust limbs and girdles (for terrestrial locomotion), and small, tall skulls (for vertically-aligned jaw muscles) are all terrestrialized traits that resemble those of more derived amniotes; on the other hand, they retain some plesiomorphic traits such as an otic notch (stapes is still used for hearing), labyrinthodont palatal tusks, and a lateral line system (underwater sensory apparatus). As you can see from **_[Archeria](#21_archeriaverts)_**, the vertebral centra are formed with equal contributions from large, disk-shaped pleurocentra and intercentra.

The **Seymouriamorpha** are an Early Permian group comprising two distinct morphs, both of which went through metamorphosis. The **expanded neural arches** of species like **_[Seymouria](#306_seymouriaslab)_** provided increased surface area for epaxial muscles to attach to, indicating a primarily terrestrial lifestyle. The **pleurocentrum** has increased in size relative to the intercentrum, and is now the **dominant element of the vertebral body**.

The **[Diadectimorpha](#7_diadectesskull)** lived from the Late Carboniferous to the Early Permian, and were the last step on the line to crown amniotes. This group is more derived than the lepospondyls, having **lost both the lateral line system and the otic notch.**  There is evidence of a shift away from plesiomorphic inertial feeding and towards derived **static pressure feeding**—the palate lacks tusks, and an **incipient pterygoid flange** suggests the presence of a pterygoideus muscle. Two major groups are known: the carnivorous, semi-aquatic **[limnoscelids,](#308_limnosceliswhole)** and the large, herbivorous **[diadectiids](#307_diadectesphaseolinuswhole)**, which possessed massive girdles and small peglike teeth.
