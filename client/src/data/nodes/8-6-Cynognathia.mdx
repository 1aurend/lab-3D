# 8.6 Cynognathia


### (Early Triassic - Late Triassic)

Key Features



*   **[Very deep zygomatic arch](#317_diademodontetragonusskull)**

**Cynognathia** (“dog-jaw”) is defined as the least-inclusive clade including **_[Exaeretodon](#459_exaeretodonwhole)_** and excluding _Probainognathus_. This group includes the carnivorous **Cynognathidae** and the herbivorous **Gomphodontia,**and is characterized by a **deep zygomatic arch** and **diverse tooth morphologies.**

The **[Cynognathidae](#460_cynognathusskull)** retained the carnivorous lifestyle ancestral to cynodonts; many of their cheek teeth preserve wear from chewing meat, indicating both carnivory and mastication. This clade persisted until the Middle Triassic before going extinct.

The **Gomphodontia** (“peg-tooth”) comprise the Early and Middle Triassic **[Diademodontidae](#317_diademodontetragonusskull)**(“band-tooth”), and the **[Traversodontidae](#455_pascualgnathuspolanskiiwholeskull)** (“across-tooth”), which survived until the end of the Triassic. These herbivorous animals featured **precise tooth occlusion**  and often **propalinal jaw motion,** likely for shearing plant matte rbetween their cheek teeth. The traversodontids were quite successful, with over 20 species known from the Middle and Late Triassic.
