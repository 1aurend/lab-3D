The **Ornithopoda** (“bird-foot”) include duck-billed dinosaurs (Hadrosauridae) and their close relatives. Ornithopods are one of the most successful and diverse groups of ornithischians. The clade is completely herbivorous, with derived members evolving **[complex mastication mechanisms.](#52_corythosaurusmandible)**

The basal groups include the **[Hypsilophodontidae](#247_hypsilophodonwhole)**(“high-crested-tooth”), which were small and bipedal. This group of animals from the Middle Jurassic to Late Cretaceous around the world can be distinguished by their rod-like prepubic process. Additionally, there are a few other progressive outgroups to hadrosaurids. This grade includes animals like _**[Tenontosaurus,](#228_tenontosauruswhole)[Camptosaurus](#246_camptosauruswhole)**_  and **_[Iguanodon.](#248_mantellisauruswhole)_**These animals show variation in body size and progressively less bipedal posture. Iguanodon was one of the very first dinosaurs to be described, though the **[initial reconstruction](#249_iguanodonreconstruction)** proved to be very inaccurate.

The most diverse and best-known group of ornithopods are the **[Hadrosauridae](#250_kritosauruswhole)**(“stout-lizard”). These “duck-billed dinosaurs” were essentially giant, Late Cretaceous cows. They converged on the dental batteries first seen in the Ceratopsidae, and had a hinged maxilla that allowed the face to flex as upper and lower teeth came into contact. Some of these animals evolved **[elaborate cranial crests](#251_parasaurolophusskull)** and complex nasal passages, which may have been used in communication and species recognition.
