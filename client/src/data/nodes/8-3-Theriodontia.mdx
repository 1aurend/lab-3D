## Key Features



*   **[Coronoid process on enlarged dentary](#449_gorynychusmasyutinaeskull)**
*   **[Snout broader than deep](#312_inostranceviaalexandriskull)**

**Theriodontia** (“beast-tooth”) is a node-based clade that includes the most recent common ancestor of **Gorgonopsia** and extant mammals, and all of that ancestor’s descendants. In addition to the gorgonopsians, this clade also includes the **Therocephalia** and the **Cynodontia** (including mammals). Theriodonts share several features of the skull with extant mammals, most notably **[strongly-differentiated dentition](#451_bauriaskull),[a broader snout](#450_moschorhinusskull),**and a **[coronoid process of the dentary](#449_gorynychusmasyutinaeskull)** for muscle attachment. Along with the dicynodonts, the therocephalians and the cynodonts are the only three synapsid lineages to survive the Permian-Triassic extinction.

The **[Gorgonopsia](#312_inostranceviaalexandriskull)**(“terrible-face”) were medium to large carnivores that dominated Late Permian ecosystems. Their **[gracile postcranial skeletons](#454_inostranceviaalexandriwhole)**suggest that the gorgonopsians may have been capable of rapid locomotion while pursuing prey. Studies of cranial anatomy have revealed powerful jaws with very large gapes (up to 90°), allowing the use of **[enlarged, serrated canines](#439_smilesaurusferoxskull)** for killing prey. These specialized saber teeth were so long that some gorgonopsians developed a trough on their dentaries to protect them, giving their faces a distinctive, blunt appearance shared with later saber-toothed predators.

Sister to the Cynodontia were the **[Therocephalia](#453_moschorhinuskitchingiskull)**(“beast-head”), known from the Middle Permian to the Middle Triassic. While not as diverse as some other therapsid clades, therocephalians nevertheless exhibited a range of forms, including small insectivores, large carnivores, and even herbivores in the Early Triassic. Therocephalians can be recognized by their **enlarged temporal fenestrae, enlarged canines, wide, ridged teeth, and reduced phalanx count.**
