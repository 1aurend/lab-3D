### (Late Jurassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Asymmetrical flight feathers ](#291_archaeopteryxwhole)**
*   **[Reduced tail](#108_archaeopteryxanimation)**
*   **[Reduced dentition and increased cranial kinesis](#296_ichthyornishead)**

**Avialae** (“bird-wings”) is subject to change based on the shifting relationships at the base of the bird tree, but it is generally thought of as the clade including all animals closer to extant birds than to _Deinonychus._ These animals are characterized by **feathered wings,** and probably at least some capacity for powered flight.

The most famous avialan is, of course, **_[Archaeopteryx,](#39_archaeopteryxwhole)_**but many other stem birds are known, including **_[Jeholornis,](#297_jeholorniswhole)[Sapeornis,](#295_sapeorniswhole)[Confuciusornis,](#294_confuciusorniswhole)[Hesperornis,](#293_hesperorniswhole)_**and _**[Ichthyornis.](#51_ichthyornishumerus)**_ These form progressive nesting clades (Pygostylia, Ornithothoraces, Ornithourae) towards the bird crown (Aves). Many of the synapomorphies you will find listed for the crown group are actually first seen in these stem birds, but we have lumped them together under Aves for simplicity.
