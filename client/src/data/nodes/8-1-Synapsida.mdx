**Synapsida** (“together-arch”) is defined as a stem group including those amniotes more closely related to extant mammals than to sauropsids. The clade is named for the presence of a single opening posterior to the orbit, the **[ lateral temporal fenestra.](#97_dimetrodonlimbatusskull) ** This structure is sometimes referred to as an infratemporal fenestra, but we avoid that terminology since the synapsid fenestra is is convergent on the infratemporal fenestra in diapsids, rather than homologous to it). Synapsidaincludes several extinct groups in addition to mammals, including a basal, paraphyletic assemblage known as the **“pelycosaurs”**(“basin-lizard”).

The **Caseasauria** include two groups, the **[Caseidae](#462_cotylorhynchuswhole)** and the **[Eothyrididae](#427_eothyrisskull)**(“dawn-shield”). Both are distinguished by their low, broad skulls and pointed snouts. Although considered basal synapsids, caseasaurs do not appear in the fossil record until the Early Permian. The **[caseids](#426_caseaskull)** were heavily-built, barrel-shaped herbivores that ranged up to five meters in length, but had comically tiny heads. Their skulls have a **pineal foramen, greatly expanded external nares,**and **cusped dentition** . They are known from the Early and Middle Permian of Russia, Europe, and North America. Meanwhile, the small-bodied **eothyridids** are known only from cranial material found in North American Permian rock.

The **[Ophiacodontidae](#71_ophiacodonverts)** (“serpent-tooth”) are the first synapsids to appear in the fossil record, emerging in the Pennsylvanian of North America and Europe and persisting until the Early Permian. The group includes the oldest synapsid fossil known, a partial skeleton of **_[Archaeothyris](#428_archaeothyrisflorensisskull)_** from the Morien Group of Nova Scotia. The type species of this clade, **_Ophiacodon_**, is between 1.5 and 4 meters long, much larger than most other amniotes of its time. Its **long, deep skull** and **wide, toothy gape** points to a predatory ecology, while its **[tall, broad neural spines](#71_ophiacodonverts)** likely supported extensive axial musculature for terrestrial locomotion.  The lateral temporal fenestra and orbit are both small, and positioned high up and posteriorly in the skull.

The **Varanopidae** (“varanid-face”) are smaller than the ophiacodontids, and carnivorous. Although some material is known from the Late Carboniferous of North America and the Middle Permian of Russia and South Africa, most specimens are from the Early Permian of North America. Varanopids have long, lightly built limbs that suggest an active, terrestrial, predatory lifestyle. As exemplified by **_[Varanops](#431_varanopsbrevirostriswhole)_**, the members of this clade have long, slender snouts, slimmer than those of ophiacodontids and with dentition extending much further posterior in the jaw.

The **[Edaphosauridae](#432_edaphosauruspogoniaswhole)** (“floor-lizard”) are among the oldest synapsids in the fossil record, appearing in the late Pennsyl- vanian and persisting until the end of the Early Permian, primarily in North America. Edaphosaurids are easily identified by their **[elongated neural spines,](#73_edaphosaurusspine)**which are circular in cross-section and are studded with small transverse bars or knobs. These neural spines are thought to have been covered by skin, forming a large **sail**. Like most edaphosaurids, **_Edaphosaurus_** is thought to have been herbivorous, with its large, barrel-shaped body, small head, and reduced marginal dentition supplemented by **[numerous small denticles](#433_edaphosaurusdenticles)** on the palatines, pterygoids, and ectopterygoids. Further evidence of herbivory is given by the position of the jaw articulation below the level of the tooth row, and a jaw joint that facilitates anterior-posterior motion.

The **[Sphenacodontidae](#97_dimetrodonlimbatusskull)** (“wedge-point-tooth”) were large-bodied apex predators known from the Late Pennsylvanian to the Middle Permian. This clade includes **_[Sphenacodon](#434_sphenacodonferoxwhole)_** and **_[Dimetrodon](#435_dimetrodonwhole)_**, the iconic ‘not-dinosaur’ from gift shops and children’s books. Sphenacodontids are distinguished by their **large skulls** and **serrated ziphodont teeth.**Several features identify them as more closely related to the Therapsida than edaphosaurids, including **[differentiated canine teeth](#438_dimetrodonanderyopsskulls),[contact between the maxilla and the nasal](#437_sphenacodonferoxskulldiagram),** and **a reflected lamina of the angular.** As with the edaphosaurids, the precise function of the sphenacodontid sail remains a mystery, although various researchers have proposed that it may have functioned as a muscle attachment, in intraspecific signaling, or as a thermoregulatory device.
