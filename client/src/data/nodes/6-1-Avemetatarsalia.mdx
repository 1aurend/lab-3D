# 6.1 Avemetatarsalia


### (Middle Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Advanced mesotarsal joint](#125_coelophysiswhole)**

**Avemetatarsalia** (“bird-middle bones of the foot”) includes those animals descended from the most recent common ancestor of birds and Pterosauria (which we will discuss in the next lab). This clade has at various points been known by several other names: Ornithodira, Ornithosuchia, and Pan-Aves, but all of these terms refer to those archosaurs that are more closely related to birds than to crocodylians.

Avemetatarsalians are characterized by an **advanced mesotarsal joint,** where a large astragalus and a small calcaneum are locked togther and function as the axis of a simple hinge joint between the lower leg and the foot.
