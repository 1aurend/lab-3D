# 7.7 Procolophonia


### (Middle Permian - Late Triassic?)

This clade of parareptiles includes two groups in addition to (possibly) turtles, the **Pareiasauria** and the **Procolophonidae**. The **[pareiasaurs](#409_scutosauruskarpinskiiwhole)** were a group of large (up to 3m) herbivores from the Mid-Late Permian of Africa, Europe, and Asia. They are distinguished by their **[bony cranial protuberances.](#60_elginiaskull)**

**[Procolophonids](#408_sauropareionwhole)** were much smaller herbivores from the Upper Permian and Triassic of Russia, South Africa, and Madagascar.
