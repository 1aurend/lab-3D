# 6.0 Archosauria


### (Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Antorbital](#9_gracilisuchusskull)** and **[mandibular](#3_alligatormississipiensisskull)** fenestrae
*   **[Perforated acetabulum](#12_alligatormississipiensiship)** in hip
*   **[Fourth trochanter](#13_alligatormississipiensisfemur)** on femur

We discussed **Archosauria** at greater length in **Lab 5,**but here are a few important archosaur synapomorphies that you should keep in mind while we explore the world of dinosaurs—you should be able to see these characters in a lot of the specimens in this lab.


# 6.1 Avemetatarsalia/Ornithodira


### (Middle Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Advanced mesotarsal joint](#125_coelophysiswhole)**

**Avemetatarsalia** (“bird-middle bones of the foot”) includes those animals descended from the most recent common ancestor of birds and Pterosauria (which we will discuss in the next lab). This clade has at various points been known by several other names: Ornithodira, Ornithosuchia, and Pan-Aves, but all of these terms refer to those archosaurs that are more closely related to birds than to crocodylians.

Avemetatarsalians are characterized by an **advanced mesotarsal joint,** where a large astragalus and a small calcaneum are locked togther and function as the axis of a simple hinge joint between the lower leg and the foot.


# 6.2 Dinosauria


### (Middle Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Ascending process on astragalus](#216_tyrannosaurusrextrixwhole)**
*   **[Distinct femoral head offset 90° from shaft](#43_staurikosaurusfemur)**
*   **[Elongated deltopectoral crest](#217_hypacrosaurus)**

Extant avian dinosaurs are famously diverse (second only to osteichthyans among vertebrates), but extinct **Dinosauria** were much more anatomically disparate. Dinosauria unites two lineages, the **Ornithischia** and the **Saurischia.** Stem dinosaurs are identified by the nested nodes **Dinosauromorpha** and **Dinosauriformes.** These are valid groupings, but there is so little fossil material that we will not discuss them at length here. These Triassic animals, including **_[Ixalerpeton](#218_ixalerpetonmodel)_** and **_[Marasuchus](#219_marasuchusskeleton)_** (which may be synonymous with _Marasuchus_), were smaller, long-limbed avemetatarsalians that may have had bipedal or facultatively-bipedal gaits.

Three postcranial characters are diagnostic of dinosaurs: an **ascending process on the astragalus** that overlaps with the anterior surface of the tibia, an **elongated deltopectoral crest**on the humerus **f** or the attachment of the deltoideus and pectoralis muscles, and a **distinct femoral head offset 90° from the diaphysis of the femur.** This latter feature relates to the derived, erect limb posture used by dinosaurs, as opposed to the sprawling limb posture used by most other tetrapods.

The MCZ’s Vertebrate Paleontology collection has a selection of dinosaur material, including a **[dinosaur egg!](#6_dinosauriaegg)**


# 6.3 Ornithischia


### (Late Triassic - Late Cretaceous)


## Key Features



*   **[Caudally-oriented “bird-like” pubis](#55_othnielosauruswhole)** parallel to ischium, with prepubic process
*   **[Palpebral bone](#33_heterodontosaurusskull) **extends over orbit
*   **[Predentary bone](#119_protoceratopsskull)** rostral to dentary forms part of beak
*   **[“Leaf-shaped” tooth crowns expanded above root](#129_iguanodonteeth)**
*   **[Ossified tendons overlying sacrals](#45_tenontosaurustendons)**

The **Ornithischia** were a very diverse group, in which multiple lineages convergently evolved towards large body size and quadrupedality. The clade name (“bird-hip”) is a reference to the **caudal orientation of the pubis,** which slots up against the ischium. Note that while the ornithischian hip morphology is convergent on the bird condition, modern birds are actually members of the sister group Saurischia (“lizard- hip”). This adaptation is thought to have increased the volume of the abdominal cavity, creating extra space for breaking down plant matter via gut fermentation.

All ornithischians are thought to have beem at least partially herbivorous—their **predentary beaks** and **leaf-like teeth** reflect a browsing ecology. A novel ossification called the **palpebral** bone extends over the orbit; its exact function is unknown, but it may have protected the eye from sun or impacts. A bundle of **ossified tendons overlying the sacral vertebrae** is a synapomorphy of ornithischians, although these occur in some therpods as well.

A few basal ornithischians are known, including **_[Pisanosaurus](#221_pisanosaurusskeleton)_** (from the Late Triassic) and a group known as the **_[Heterodontisaurdae](#222_heterodontosaurustuckiskeleton)_** (Late Triassic - Early Cretaceous). These basal lineages were smaller than later forms, and retained an erect, bipedal posture. Interestingly, early ornithischians show some evidence of hair-like integumentary structures which may or may not be related to the feathers that emerge on the saurischian line.


# 6.4 Thyreophora


### (Early Jurassic - Late Cretaceous)


## Key Features



*   **[Osteoderms](#223_ankylosaurosteoderm)**
*   **[Flared postorbital process of jugal](#44_edmontoniaskull)**

The armored **Thyreophora** (“shield-bearer”) are one of three major groups of ornithischian dinosaurs, and include the iconic stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. The derived members of this group are recognizable by their heavy dermal ornamentation and armor, but more basal Jurassic thyreophorans, such as _Scutellosaurus_ and _Scelidosaurus,_ exhibit a moasaic of tiny **osteoderms** covering the body. The small, bipedal **_[Scutellosaurus](#232_scutellosaurusreconstruction)_** resembles a basal ornithischian, but with scutes. By comparison, **_[Scelidosaurus](#233_scelidosauruswhole)_** is larger and quadrupedal, like more derived thyreophorans.

The **[Stegosauria](#234_stegosauruswhole)** (“roof-lizard”) are one of the two major derived thyreophoran clades. These small-headed, quadrupedal animals had relatively long hindlimbs, making them much taller and bulkier at the hip than at the shoulder. They are recognizable by the **osteoderm-derived plates and spines** all over their bodies (parascapular spines, parasagittal plate/spike rows, caudal thagomizer), the tall neural spines on their dorsal vertebrae, and their **[reduced or absent antorbital fenestrae.](#224_stegosaurusarmatusskull)**

The other major thyreophoran clade are the **[Ankylosauria](#225_euoplocephalusskull)** (“bent/crooked-lizard”), which had a cosmopoli- tan distribution (worldwide except for Africa) from the Middle Jurassic to the Cretaceous. Ankylosaurs feature extensive **[osteoderms](#237_borealopelta)** elaborated into a bony dorsal armor covering. They are even more strangely proportioned than stegosaurs, with extremely wide bodies that overhang the limb girdles. Some of their dorsal, sacral, and caudal vertebrae were fused into a synsacrum, and unusually for dinosaurs, their ac- etabular fenestrae were secondarily closed. Their skulls were often ornamented and lacked fenestrae, but contained **[convoluted nasal passages](#235_kunbarrasaurusieversinasalpassages)** that may have aided in cooling the brain. Many ankylosaurs had tail clubs, but we also know of several that lacked this specialization, including **_[Edmontonia.](#236_edmontoniawhole)_**


# 6.5 Marginocephalia


### (Late Jurassic - Late Cretaceous)


## Key Features



*   **[Skull shelf](#238_triceratopshorridusskull)** formed by fusion of parietals and squamosals
*   **[Reduced pubis](#226_psittacosauruswhole) **(prepubic process retained)
*   **Reduced premaxilla contribution to palate**

**Marginocephalia** includes the “dome-headed” Pachycephalosauria and the frilled Ceratopsia. This group is united by the presence of fused parietals and squamosals, creating a defined margin along the back of the skull.

The **[Pachycephalosauria](#220_pachycephalosauruswyomingensis)** (“thick-head-lizard”) are known only from the Cretaceous and have a **[distinctive, thickened skull roof,](#239_stegocerasvalidumskull)**which is sometimes ornamented with bony bulbs and spikes. The function of the thick skulls is not completely understood: some evidence suggests competitive head-butting, but other studies suggest that the forces involved would have killed the animals. What is known is that the skulls show complex ontogeny, with horns and bumps appearing early in life before fusing to form the full dome. Unlike derived ceratopsians, pachycephalosaurs retain bipedality. They can also be identified by the reduced pubic contribution to their acetabulum.

The **[Ceratopsia](#126_triceratopswhole)** (“horn-face”) are a charismatic group known from the Late Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous. Ceratopsians can be recognized by the rostral bone at the end of their premaxilla, which forms the base of a large, plant-cropping beak. They also feature distinctive **** flared jugals **** for muscle attachment. In addition to the beak, these herbivorous animals have long rows of shearing teeth for processing vegetation. The derived **Ceratopsidae,**such as **_[Triceratops](#244_triceratopswhole)_** and **_[Styracosaurus,](#243_styracosaurusskull)_** were large, quadrupedal animals with spectacular cranial horns and frills, while basal ceratopsians like **_[Psittacosaurus](#242_psittacosaurusskull)_** were bipedal and frill-less. Interestingly, _Psittacosaurus_ has been found preserved with[ long bristles ](#241_psittacosaurusbristles)that may or may not be homologous with feathers. If _Psittacosaurus’_ bristles are indeed proto-feathers, that would make feathers plesiomorphic for dinosaurs as a whole, not just theropods. **_[Protoceratops](#240_protoceratopsandrewsiwhole)_** is known from the Late Cretaceous of Asia and is still relatively small, but likely partially quadrupedal. _Protoceratops_ shows a developed skull frill and incipient facial horns, as well as closely-spaced shearing teeth.


# 6.6 Ornithopoda


### (Middle Jurassic - Late Cretaceous)


## Key Features



*   **[Jaw joint below tooth row](#231_dryosaurusaltusskull)**
*   **[Toothless premaxilla occludes with predentary ](#245_corythosaurusskull)**(like lips)
*   **[Dental batteries](#37_hadrosauridaedentalbattery)**
*   **[Obturator process on pubis](#227_edmontosaurusannectens)**

The **Ornithopoda** (“bird-foot”) include duck-billed dinosaurs (Hadrosauridae) and their close relatives. Ornithopods are one of the most successful and diverse groups of ornithischians. The clade is completely herbivorous, with derived members evolving **[complex mastication mechanisms.](#52_corythosaurusmandible)**

The basal groups include the **[Hypsilophodontidae](#247_hypsilophodonwhole)**(“high-crested-tooth”), which were small and bipedal. This group of animals from the Middle Jurassic to Late Cretaceous around the world can be distinguished by their rod-like prepubic process. Additionally, there are a few other progressive outgroups to hadrosaurids. This grade includes animals like _**[Tenontosaurus,](#228_tenontosauruswhole)[Camptosaurus](#246_camptosauruswhole)**_  and **_[Iguanodon.](#248_mantellisauruswhole)_**These animals show variation in body size and progressively less bipedal posture. Iguanodon was one of the very first dinosaurs to be described, though the **[initial reconstruction](#249_iguanodonreconstruction)** proved to be very inaccurate.

The most diverse and best-known group of ornithopods are the **[Hadrosauridae](#250_kritosauruswhole)**(“stout-lizard”). These “duck-billed dinosaurs” were essentially giant, Late Cretaceous cows. They converged on the dental batteries first seen in the Ceratopsidae, and had a hinged maxilla that allowed the face to flex as upper and lower teeth came into contact. Some of these animals evolved **[elaborate cranial crests](#251_parasaurolophusskull)** and complex nasal passages, which may have been used in communication and species recognition.


# 6.7 Saurischia


### (Late Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Subnarial foramen ](#259_herrerasaurusskull)**
*   **[Accessory articulations in the dorsal vertebrae (hyposphene & hypantrum) ](#257_sauropodvert)**
*   Elongated necks with **[pneumatized cervical vertebrae](#269_diplodocusvert)**

**Saurischia** are the other, and only extant, lineage of dinosaurs. These “lizard-hipped” dinosaurs are so named because they retain the ancestral condition of a cranially-oriented pubis, although this changes as we get closer to birds. Saurischia is itself divided into the sauropod lineage **Sauropodomorpha** and the bird lineage **Theropoda.** The **Herrerasauridae,**such as **_[Staurikosaurus,](#258_staurikosauruswhole)_**are either basal saurischians or basal theropods, and exhibit many of the synapomorphies for Saurischia.

Saurischians can be recognized by the presence of a small **subnarial foramen** ventral to the naris/external nostril, **additional articulations called the hyposphene and the hypantrum**that form tongue-and-groove connections between the dorsal vertebrae and may have had a stiffening function, as well as **elongated necks with pneumatized cervical vertebrae** to accommodate air sacs for gas exchange.


# 6.8 Sauropoda


### (Early Jurassic - Late Cretaceous)


## Key Features



*   **[Peg-like dentition](#261_diplodocusskull)**
*   **[Extremely long neck](#260_seismosaurusandsaurophaganaxwhole)**

**Sauropoda** (“lizard-foot”) includes the giant **long-necked**dinosaurs and their closest relatives. Animals in this clade exhibit a trend towards quadrupedality and enormous body size, as well as columnar limbs to support their weight. The giant derived sauropods are familiar to many, but **Sauropodomorpha** also encompasses a paraphyletic grade of basal Late Triassic **[“Prosauropods”.](#32_sarahsaurusskull)**These animals are still bipedal and generally small-bodied, although some like **_[Plateosaurus](#262_plateosauruswhole)_** grew up to 9 meters long. They can be recognized by the presence of a large ungual on the thumb.

Sauropoda includes the largest terrestrial vertebrates to have ever lived, including the 100-ton, 40-meter Argentinosaurus. These animals were the dominant terrestrial herbivores, with incredibly long necks and relatively tiny skulls. Histological studies reveal that they grew quickly like birds, attaining their full size in 10-20 years. One of the best-known sauropod groups are the **[Diplodocoidea](#263_diplodocuswhole)**(“double-beam”), which include **_[Diplodocus](#131_diplodocusskull)_** and **_[Apatosaurus.](#264_apatosauruslouisaewhole)_** These animals are known from the Late Jurassic until the Cretaceous, and are characterized by elongate tails, short forelimbs, and square snouts with teeth only at the tip. Their nares tend to fuse together at the midline, but are smaller than those of the macronarians.

The **[Macronaria](#203_camarosaurusskull)** (“large-nostril”) are the most derived sauropod clade**.**These Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous dinosaurs are named for their enormous, dorsally-positioned nares, which are even larger than their orbits. Macronarians tend to have relatively longer forelimbs than the diplodocoids. Some macronarians lose the manual digits entirely, and stand on their metacarpals instead. This group includes animals like **[Camarasaurus,](#265_camarosauruswhole)** **[Brachiosaurus,](#266_brachiosauruswhole)** and the **[Titanosauridae.](#267_sarmientosaurusskull)** The validity of “Brontosaurus” was called into question when it was proposed that the type specimen was actually the skull of Camarasaurus on the body of Apatosaurus, but a more recent analysis has since resurrected the taxon.


# 6.9 Theropoda


### (Late Triassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Pneumatized vertebrae ](#256_spinosaurusvert)and [long bones ](#268_deinonychusproximalhumerus)**
*   **[Intramandibular joint](#254_gorgosaurusskull)**
*   **[Reduced manual digit V ](#273_coelophysisbauriwhole)**

The **Theropoda** (“beast-foot”) are those dinosaurs closer to birds than to sauropods, and include many of the large carnivorous predators from the Mesozoic. Basal theropods include forms like **_[Eoraptor](#270_eoraptorlunensiswhole)_** and **_[Coelophysis.](#34_coelophysisskull)_**Many theropods from the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic were relatively small animals that retained many features of basal dinosauromorphs. Some basal theropods grew to larger sizes, like the crested ** _[Dilophosaurus,](#271_dilophosauruswhole)_ ** which was much larger in reality than the animal depicted in Jurassic Park. More derived theropods are grouped under **Neotheropoda,** which includes the horned, short-armed **ceratosaurs**like **_[Carnotaurus,](#272_carnotauruswhole)_** as well as the stiff-tailed **tetanurans.**

Theropods can be identified by their **pneumatized vertebrae and long bones,** the **intramandibular joint**between the angular/surangular and the dentary, and the **reduced digit V on the manus** (the pinky). Many also have **serrated teeth**  for cutting through flesh. In addition to the simiplification of the manus (hand), there is also a trend towards **[tridactyly in the pes](#35_coelophysisfoot)(foot).**


# 6.10 Tetanurae


### (Jurassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Large, tridactyl manus (hand), with manual digits IV and V lost](#274_crylophosauruswhole)**
*   **[Stiffened tail with interlocking caudal vertebrae ](#260_seismosaurusandsaurophaganaxwhole)**
*   **[Strap-like scapula](#274_crylophosauruswhole)**
*   **[Teeth concentrated towards front of jaw](#41_allosaurusskull)**

**Tetanurae** (“stretch-tail”) includes those theropods more closely related to _Tyrannosaurus_ than to _Coelo-_ physis. This clade’s name references their stiffened tails, but tetanurans and more derived clades also show increased lightening of the cranial and post-cranial skeleton, beginning in Tetanura with the **maxillary fenestra**(rostral to the antorbital fenestra).

Basal tetanurans include two main groups: the **Megalosauroidea** and the **Allosauroidea**. The Megalosauroidea have elongate skulls and strong forelimbs with large manual digit I unguals, and include **_[Megalosaurus,](#275_megalosauruspelviclimb)_** the first non-avian theropod to be named (as with _Iguanodon,_the **[first reconstructions were laughably inaccurate](#290_megalosaurusreconstruction)**), as well as **_[Spinosaurus,](#277_spinosauruswhole)_** a giant water-dwelling piscivore with a sail composed of elongated neural spines. The Allosauroidea are named after their most famous member, **_[Allosaurus,](#255_allosaurusskull)_**but also include the **[cacharodontosaurs,](#276_carcharodontosaurtooth)** so-named for their flattened, shark-like teeth. Allosauroids are the first to exhibit the **[enlarged, boot-shaped pubic peduncle](#38_allosauruspubicboot)**characteristic of derived theropods.


# 6.11 Coelurosauria


### (Late Jurassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Enlarged orbits and brains ](#30_gallimimusskull)**
*   **[Long metatarsals](#118_tyrannosauruswhole)**
*   **[Protofeathers](#278_sinosauropteryxwhole)**

**Coelurosauria** (“hollow-tail-lizard”) includes those tetanurans more derived than Allosauroidea. This group includes **_[Compsognathus,](#17_compsognathuswhole)_**one of the smallest non-avian theropods, known from the same Jurassic Solnhofen deposits that gave us _Archaeopteryx._ Basal members of this group include the **Tyrannosauroidea** and the **Ornithomimosauria.**The massive, tiny-armed ** _[Tyrannosaurus rex](#216_tyrannosaurusrextrixwhole)_ **  needs no introduction, but many of its close relatives were much smaller. **[Tyrannosaurids](#280_gorgosauruslibratuswhole)** are distinguished by their fused nasals, wide skulls, and incisiform premaxillary teeth, and tend to have elongate legs with **long metatarsals. Ornithomimids,**like **_[Gallimimus,](#279_gallimimuswhole)_**are called “ostrich mimics” due to their tiny skulls, long, slender hindlimbs, and reduced teeth. The bizarre, long-armed Deinocheirus also falls within this group. As well as **enlarged orbits and brains,** Coelurosauria is also where we see the first definitive **simple feathers,** as exemplified by **_[Sinosauropteryx.](#280_gorgosauruslibratuswhole)_**


# 6.12 Maniraptora


### (Late Jurassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Very long arms](#283_ajancingeniawhole)**
*   **[Ossified sternum](#282_citipatiosmolskaewhole)**

This node is where saurischian dinosaurs begin to look very much like birds. Limbs get longer, and the **pubis begins to angle backwards** to point ventrally or even caudoventrally. The best-known members of the **Maniraptora** (“hand-plunderer”) are the derived dromaeosaurian “raptors”, which tend to feature heavily in pop-culture depictions of dinosaurs. The **Dromaeosauridae** and their sister group the **Troodontidae** are grouped under a separate node closer to birds, the **Paraves,** but the rest of the maniraptorans are just as fascinating. **[Therizinosauroidea](#253_erlikosaurusskull)** are a clade of bizarre, massive maniraptorans that were originally thought to be predatory based on their **[enormous clawed forelimbs.](#281_therizinosaurusarms)** They are now thought to have been omnivorous or herbivorous. The **Oviraptorosauria** were feathered maniraptorans with boxy, beaked, sometimes crested skulls and short, birdlike tails. They were originally thought to be egg-eaters based on a **[famous fossil of an oviraptorosaur in association with a nest,](#284_citipatiosmolskaenest)** but the eggs were later discovered to be the dinosaur’s own. Oviraptors have a fused semi-lunate carpal in their wrists, which allowed their hands to adopt a flexed, wing-like posture. The diminutive, small-handed **[Alvarezsauridae](#285_patagonykuswhole)** are sometimes grouped with the maniraptorans, but relationships in this region of the tree tend to shift around with each new analysis.


# 6.13 Paraves


### (Late Jurassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Even longer arms](#49_deinonychushumerus) **with very large hands (incipient wings)
*   **[Distally-stiffened tail](#40_deinonychusfoottail)**
*   **[Caudoventrally-directed opisthopubic pelvis](#252_dromaeosauruswhole)**

Paraves (“beside-birds”) includes the last common ancestor of the **Dromaeosauridae,**the **Troodontidae,**and extant birds. This group is characterized by **long, stiff tails,** **large, winglike hands**and a **pubis beginning to angle backwards**like a bird’s, as well as by retractable sickle claws on the pedal digit II. The **dromaeosaurs** (“running lizards”) included smaller, fast-moving pack hunters like **_[Deinonychus](#286_deinonychusskull)_** and pop-culture favorite **_[Velociraptor,](#287_velociraptorwhole)_** as well as larger, solitary predators like **_[Utahraptor.](#288_utahraptorwhole)_**The **[Troodontidae](#289_sinovenatorwhole)** were small, gracile animals with large eyes and some of the highest encephalization quotients among extinct Dinosauria.


# 6.14 Avialae


### (Late Jurassic - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Asymmetrical flight feathers ](#291_archaeopteryxwhole)**
*   **[Reduced tail](#108_archaeopteryxanimation)**
*   **[Reduced dentition and increased cranial kinesis](#296_ichthyornishead)**

**Avialae** (“bird-wings”) is subject to change based on the shifting relationships at the base of the bird tree, but it is generally thought of as the clade including all animals closer to extant birds than to _Deinonychus._ These animals are characterized by **feathered wings,** and probably at least some capacity for powered flight.

The most famous avialan is, of course, **_[Archaeopteryx,](#39_archaeopteryxwhole)_**but many other stem birds are known, including **_[Jeholornis,](#297_jeholorniswhole)[Sapeornis,](#295_sapeorniswhole)[Confuciusornis,](#294_confuciusorniswhole)[Hesperornis,](#293_hesperorniswhole)_**and _**[Ichthyornis.](#51_ichthyornishumerus)**_ These form progressive nesting clades (Pygostylia, Ornithothoraces, Ornithourae) towards the bird crown (Aves). Many of the synapomorphies you will find listed for the crown group are actually first seen in these stem birds, but we have lumped them together under Aves for simplicity.


# 6.15 Aves/Neornithes


### (Late Cretaceous - Present)


## Key Features



*   **[Synsacrum (fused pelvis and sacral vertebrae) ](#196_pelecanuswhole)**
*   **[Tibiotarsus and tarsometarsus ](#8_comparativelimbslimbs)**
*   **[Pygostyle](#197_antigonewhole)**
*   **[Pubis runs parallel to ischium ](#298_diatrymawhole)**
*   **[Sternal keel](#20_diomedeagirdles)**
*   **[Tri-osseal canal from scapula and coracoid,](#301_aquilaaudaxscapulocoracoid)** for passage of supracoracoideus tendon
*   **[11 or fewer thoracic vertebrae](#149_struthiowhole)**
*   **[Teeth are lost](#300_whekauskull)**
*   **[Highly-pneumatized long bones](#299_avespartial)**

Extant **[Aves](#54_avesfeather)** (literally:“birds”) is divided into the **Palaeognathae,**which includes the flightless ratites (**os-[triches,](#149_struthiowhole)** **[cassowaries,](#304_casuariuscasuariuswhole)[kiwis,](#302_apteryxaustralisskull)**and allies) as well as the flying **[tinamous,](#303_tinamusmajorwhole)** and the **[Neognathae,](#53_gallinuloideswhole)** which includes all other living birds. Most avian synapomorphies are adaptations for weight reduction and flight. Birds tend to fuse bones (synsacrum, various long bones) and lose unneccesary structures (such as teeth). There are far too many birds to cover in this lab —you should check out the Ornithology course if you want to explore this diverse clade in full.
