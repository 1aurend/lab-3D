# 8.8 Mammaliamorpha


### (Late Triassic - Present)

**Mammaliamorpha** (“mammal-shape”) is a node-based clade that unites the most derived non-mammaliaform cynodonts with the **Mammaliaformes**.

The possibly-paraphyletic **tritheledontids** are best known from the Early Jurassic, but range from the Late Triassic into the Middle Jurassic. These small to medium-sized carnivorous or insectivorous animals lived in South America and South Africa.

**[Tritylodontids,](#75_kayentatheriumwellesiskull)** from the Late Triassic to Jurassic, are often recovered as the sister-group of Mammali- formes. Members of this clade have **enlarged incisors,** **a diastema**(gap in anterior dentition), and **reduced canines**, but still lack many derived mammaliaform features.
