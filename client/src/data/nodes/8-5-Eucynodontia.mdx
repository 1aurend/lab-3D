**Eucynodontia** (“good-dog-tooth”) unites the two great derived cynodont clades: the **Cynognathia** and the **Probainognathia**. Eucynodonts are characterized by an **extremely enlarged dentary**making up most of the length of the mandible, and **greatly-reduced, rodlike postdentary bones** that fit inside a groove on the lingual side of the dentary. The Eucynodontia radiated extensively in the Early/Middle Triassic as both carnivorous and herbivorous forms.
